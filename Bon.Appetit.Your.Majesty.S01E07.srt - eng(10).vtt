BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:51.468
ROYAL KITCHEN

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.471
I have never seen
anything like this before.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.264
What is this called?

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.559
For the third round,
where we need to make a soup dish,

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:01.728
we'll use this.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.315
This cast-iron pot

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.108
is made to be heated from the bottom,

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.652
and it traps the steam,

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.822
which allows the pressure to increase.

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:16.201
But we have not
even started the first round,

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.370
so why are we
already discussing the third round?

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:21.372
What I learned from cooking competitions

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.834
is that you have to be
well-prepared for the last round to win.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.045
Everyone does well
in the first two rounds.

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:30.799
The third round is when you become
exhausted and run out of ideas,

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:33.676
and that's the round
that separates the winner from the loser.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.514
So the key to our strategy
is to plan in reverse order.

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:41.935
For the third round, we are expected
to make soup with ginseng, are we not?

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:45.563
Ginseng eel soup, ginseng loach soup,
ginseng short rib soup.

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:47.607
The only choice is to make
one of those nourishing dishes,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.110
so why do we need a pot like this
when we already have cauldrons?

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.156
The most appropriate ginseng soup
that comes to my mind

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.575
is ogolgye samgyetang,
Silkie ginseng chicken soup.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.245
- "Ogolgye samgyetang"?
- "Ogolgye samgyetongue"?

00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:02.122
What is "samgyetongue"?

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.749
Are you saying you will make soup
with a chicken's tongue?

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:05.959
Oh, "san ge," as in "live crabs."

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:08.753
Maybe the soup includes crabs,
so it is a seafood soup of some sort.

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:11.840
I see.

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:14.717
So samgyetang didn't exist in this era.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:20.431
Samgyetang is a soup dish where a chicken,
stuffed with ginseng and medicinal herbs,

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.559
is simmered until tender.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.561
Not only do you want this ridiculous pot,

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.855
but you also want to cut open
and stuff an ogolgye, Silkie,

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:28.273
and make it into a soup?

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:31.442
If you stuff a chicken,
the stuffing will turn to mash

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:33.820
while the chicken cooks.

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.238
You do not know your soups, do you?

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.531
Of course I do.

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:39.075
Ingredients cook at different intervals,

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.870
and that's why this soup must be cooked

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:44.956
with effort and the help of science.

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.000
- Effort?
- Signs?

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:51.296
{\an8}First, we must obtain a pressure cooker
to cook the ogolgye in.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:55.550
Then this is the first effort
we put into this dish.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:58.928
{\an8}We'll then wash the ogolgye
in water filtered through loess soil

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.305
{\an8}to get rid of the gamey smell.

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:02.765
That would be the second effort.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:06.728
And lastly, we'll use red ginseng
that is at least six years old,

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:08.938
jujube, milkvetch root, dendropanax,

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.899
bellflower root,
lady bell, dried deer antler, and more.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.984
We'll use ten medicinal herbs

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:15.778
to make a broth to cook the chicken in.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.947
Exactly how much effort does it need?

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.867
Cook Yeon,
is that the last effort we put in?

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.203
Once we put our heart into the dish,

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:25.204
it's complete.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.625
It sounds like we could use our cauldron.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.710
To tenderize
the tough meat of wild ogolgye

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:32.754
at the same speed as the other ingredients

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.798
and achieve the effect of boiling
for ten hours within just one hour…

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:36.841
PRESSURE COOKER

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.801
…this is absolutely necessary.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.678
I have never seen or heard of it.

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.680
What if we cannot get this?

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:46.643
Come to your senses, Cook Min.
Where are we to find that thing?

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:47.602
I'll have it made.

00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:51.105
Cook Yeon! You are not making any sense!

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.691
Who in the world could ever make this?

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:55.985
I understand we must trust her
on this matter,

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.320
so forget everything else.

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.614
But you are saying
you want to have a pot made.

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:00.865
This is not a forge.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.533
It won't be easy,

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:04.702
but if we have this pot,

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:07.038
we can cook something
with an incomparable depth of flavor.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.958
Are you sure it can be done?

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:11.459
Yes.

00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:14.504
If my memory serves me correctly,

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:18.549
there is one man in Joseon

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:21.636
who can make this.

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:29.143
COURSE N° 7 DONGNAE PAJEON ON A RAINY DAY

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:32.897
FIRST ROUND DISH

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.030
{\an8}CHICKEN

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.282
{\an8}We're done for.

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:47.745
{\an8}What is this strange-looking thing?

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.963
{\an8}PUMPKIN RICE SYRUP

00:04:57.046 --> 00:04:59.007
{\an8}VINEGAR

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:11.602
- Ya Feixiu.
- Okay.

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:29.203
- This is gochugaru, chili powder.
- Gochogaru?

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:32.707
My gosh, it is spicy.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:35.084
This is gochujang.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.794
We'll mix these two

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:39.589
to make a sauce for the galbijjim,
braised short ribs.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.600
THIRD ROUND DISH

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:54.062
Ogolgye meat is tough
and takes a long time to cook.

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:56.022
But if you cook for too long,
it tastes bad.

00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:57.398
It is not a suitable ingredient
for a competition.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:58.524
That is exactly why

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.903
we need to use this pressure cooker.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:04.489
Water boils at 100°C,
but at 2 atmospheric pressures,

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:05.907
it boils at 120°C.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.410
In other words,
it's possible to cook the chicken

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.579
until it's so soft
you could even eat the bones.

00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:14.749
- So how is this thing made?
- Well…

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:16.292
Hang on.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.798
What is it?

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.049
That's weird.

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:24.509
It's nothing.

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:28.304
That was close.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.308
{\an8}GANGNYEONGJEON

00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:35.228
PRESSURE COOKER, PACKING,
COMPRESS, CAST-IRON POT

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:38.731
What on earth do you plan to do
with something like this?

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:41.442
I'll use it to cook the soup
in the third round.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.861
It's a very important pot
that will determine the taste of our dish.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:47.281
It's where cooking meets science.

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:51.911
Your Majesty, I need this to create a dish
that doesn't exist in this era.

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:53.079
Are you asking me

00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:56.124
to find someone who will make this?

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:57.250
That's right.

00:06:57.333 --> 00:06:59.168
Isn't there someone

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.420
called Jang Yeong-sil here?

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.631
I think he could make it.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.677
The grand military protector
who invented the hemispherical sundial

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.095
and water clock?

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:11.472
That man…

00:07:14.892 --> 00:07:17.145
The late king thought highly of him.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.438
The late king?

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.857
Then are you saying he's not here anymore?

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.777
{\an8}There might be someone at Gungisi,
Government Arsenal, who can help.

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.028
Gungisi?

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.030
It is where weapons are made for the army.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.658
They make cannons, swords, and spears.

00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:33.244
The people there can't make this.

00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:35.705
I need an inventor.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:38.875
Your Majesty.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:40.626
CHANG-SEON
CHIEF EUNUCH OF ROYAL FOOD

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.128
There is Jang Chun-saeng.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.052
{\an8}He is the descendant of the
grand military protector Jang Yeong-sil.

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.846
Jang Yeong-sil's descendant?

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:53.556
Tell us more about him.

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:57.768
He was well-known within Gungisi
for making bizarre things.

00:07:58.603 --> 00:07:59.896
He was dismissed last summer

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.899
for causing an explosion on the grounds.

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:04.609
An explosion?

00:08:04.692 --> 00:08:07.320
Where is he now?

00:08:07.403 --> 00:08:09.697
I heard he returned to his hometown.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.493
We should be able to get more information
if we inquire at Gungisi.

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.913
Your Majesty,
please let me see him immediately.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:17.955
There's no time.

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.415
There is no need to make a fuss.

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:21.709
Rushing never works--

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:23.127
Without the pressure cooker,

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.296
it'll be hard to beat the Ming cooks
with soup.

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:27.548
I really need this
to tenderize the meat of the ogolgye

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:30.676
and make the ginseng seep into the broth.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.721
We barely have enough time
to prepare for the first two rounds.

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:35.598
I have to get the other ingredients too.

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:38.100
There are plenty of ingredients
within the palace, are there not?

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:39.101
The thing is,

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:43.356
what I want are fresh ingredients
from the wild outdoors.

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:45.274
Freshly-plucked ingredients

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.068
determine how a dish turns out.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.364
Then I should accompany you.

00:08:51.447 --> 00:08:54.158
You cannot, Your Majesty.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:57.328
The envoys are at Taepyeonggwan,
Official Reception Hall.

00:08:57.411 --> 00:08:58.454
That is not all.

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.665
Cook Yeon needs to set off to prepare

00:09:00.748 --> 00:09:02.959
for a competition
that our nation's future depends on.

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:03.876
It would not be right

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.212
for you to leave the palace
at such a time, Your Majesty.

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:11.008
Very well then.

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:12.593
I will permit your departure.

00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:14.512
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:15.596
However,

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.099
I cannot allow you to travel alone.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:19.642
Pardon?

00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:22.144
Travel safely.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:23.229
I will.

00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:24.730
I'll be back soon.

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:29.819
Use it if you need men or horses.

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:30.736
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:33.823
We shall leave now, Your Majesty.

00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:37.076
Go on.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.506
Su-hyeok.

00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:55.469
Do you not think
people would find those two strange?

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.930
{\an8}I am not certain I understand,
Your Majesty.

00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:01.142
Do they not look like they are married?

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:03.311
Oh, I see what you mean, Your Majesty.

00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:06.939
Cook Yeon is too fair a lady
to be thought of as his brother,

00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:09.025
but they do not look like
a married couple.

00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:10.192
I cannot let this be.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:12.445
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.074
Will I really get Mangunrok back?

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.244
You talk about that book
whenever you see me.

00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:23.664
His Majesty said he would find it,
so stop asking about it.

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.250
It's because it's an important book to me.

00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:30.129
I'm really going to return
as soon as this competition's over.

00:10:30.212 --> 00:10:32.214
Do you still want to return that badly?

00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:34.008
What do you mean?

00:10:34.091 --> 00:10:37.136
His Majesty seems to have grown
quite fond of you.

00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:39.472
What do you mean he grew fond of me?

00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:43.225
Watching you interact with him
makes me wonder

00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:47.688
if one day I will have to speak to you
in polite speech reserved for royals.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.231
"Your Grace."

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.317
"Your Grace Yeon Ji-young."

00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:53.694
I don't believe this.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:55.738
Stop talking nonsense.

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:58.199
I'm going to go back, so don't worry.

00:10:58.282 --> 00:11:01.160
You should just take this chance
to win His Majesty's heart.

00:11:01.243 --> 00:11:02.870
Let me ask you something.

00:11:02.953 --> 00:11:05.247
What do you gain
from breathing down my neck about it?

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.041
"Breathe down your neck"? How ridiculous.

00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:08.417
I have never gone near your neck.

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:09.960
What does that mean anyway?

00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:11.504
Don't ask!

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:13.422
My goodness!

00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:16.050
Oh dear.

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:18.552
What are you doing here?

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.763
GONG-GIL
YEONHUIGUN'S JESTER WITH MANY SECRETS

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:27.353
Your Majesty.

00:11:27.436 --> 00:11:29.397
What brings you here, Your Majesty?

00:11:32.733 --> 00:11:35.277
Men and women over the age of seven
must be watched closely.

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.238
If we were to accompany Cook Yeon,

00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:39.949
she would not attract any attention
or misunderstanding.

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:43.160
Your Majesty, Cook Yeon is dressed
as a man, so you need not--

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:44.412
Enough.

00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:47.957
Anyone can tell she is a woman.

00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:51.877
Your Majesty.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.046
The envoys are at Taepyeonggwan.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.256
They are indeed.

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:58.342
That is why you should return.

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:05.516
Your duty to guard the palace
is just as important.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.727
With all due respect, Your Majesty,
you cannot do this.

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:10.396
You must walk a great distance too.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.398
This journey

00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:14.859
is to prepare for a competition
that the nation's future depends on.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:18.404
Do you not think it is only right
that I walk the distance myself?

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:23.325
We should hurry.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:25.077
We do not want to be late.

00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:27.955
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:30.082
Your Majesty…

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:31.167
Su-hyeok.

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:34.044
- Wait for me!
- Cook Yeon.

00:12:34.753 --> 00:12:35.796
Gong-gil!

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.344
Where is His Majesty?

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:43.762
He has left the palace.

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:46.140
You should have stopped him.

00:12:46.223 --> 00:12:47.391
You know this is not the time for--

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.602
How was I to stop him
when he had made up his mind

00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:51.061
and came in a disguise?

00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:54.231
I will guard the hall of governance.

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:57.318
You take care of His Majesty's chambers.

00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:06.535
His Majesty is of ill health,

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:08.829
so no morning assembly
will be held for a while.

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:14.001
Do focus on hosting the envoys
and preparing for the cooking competition.

00:13:14.084 --> 00:13:16.795
For anything else,
you may submit a written report.

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:19.006
His Majesty has fallen ill
all of a sudden?

00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:20.716
What is going on?

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:23.344
{\an8}He was fine and well just yesterday,
was he not?

00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:26.889
That is all you need to know.

00:13:28.098 --> 00:13:29.475
Excuse us then.

00:13:29.558 --> 00:13:30.476
Let us go.

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.530
Gong-gil.

00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:44.907
Where is this place?

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.535
My legs are killing me.

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:49.620
We are almost there, Your Majesty.

00:13:49.703 --> 00:13:51.080
Hang in there a bit longer.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.374
Your Majesty, when we get there,

00:13:53.874 --> 00:13:57.253
you can't say things like,
"I am the king of this country," okay?

00:13:57.878 --> 00:14:00.839
Why must I hide what is a fact?

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:02.091
What if you say that

00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:03.926
and he says something like,

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:06.512
"I am sorry,
but I cannot make what you wish."

00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:08.222
What will you do then?

00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:09.807
Then I will torture him.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.433
Your Majesty.

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.102
All right.

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:14.562
Do you promise?

00:14:17.064 --> 00:14:18.232
Jeez.

00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:19.483
We should get going.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.235
Let's go.

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:27.116
His Majesty has left the palace again?

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:28.534
Yes, Your Highness.

00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:31.495
I heard he left with the chief royal cook.

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:32.538
Why?

00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:35.708
The competition is just days away.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.002
Why did he leave at this important time?

00:14:38.085 --> 00:14:40.170
According to the maids
at the royal kitchen,

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:42.882
they are looking for a bizarre object
to use in the competition.

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:44.758
A bizarre object?

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:48.429
It might be a good idea

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:53.017
to use this as an opportunity
to cancel the competition completely.

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:55.227
Would you not agree?

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:56.478
Your Highness.

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:59.273
Should we not wait
until the envoys return to Ming?

00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:00.274
Lord Sung!

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:03.027
Do you not understand
the importance of this competition?

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.695
The outcome of this competition

00:15:04.778 --> 00:15:06.614
will ignite the flames for our revolt.

00:15:06.697 --> 00:15:07.698
You are right, Your Highness.

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:10.910
Do not forget we have well-trained men.

00:15:11.702 --> 00:15:15.539
Are you referring to the men
who are training at the Mount Guwol base?

00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:17.917
Tell them

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.879
I would like to see
the skills they have honed.

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:25.674
The target…

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.930
is the chief royal cook.

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:39.688
Are we at the right place?

00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:41.732
I am sure of it.

00:15:41.815 --> 00:15:44.234
Those at Gungisi said to go
to the end of Naesan Valley.

00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:47.154
What does that sign say?

00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:50.616
"Anyone who opens the gate
without permission

00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:53.035
will hasten their demise."

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:55.829
- "Jang Chun-saeng."
- "Jang…"

00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:58.540
This is unbelievable.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.668
This is why they say
eccentrics have no manners.

00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:02.920
How dare he say we need his permission?

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.131
Your Majesty, please!

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:13.847
Jang Chun-saeng!

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:15.891
Come forth
and show respect to your visitors.

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.309
What a pain.

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.444
It's… It's a cannon.

00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:29.905
You opened the gate so abruptly,

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.699
and it lit the cannon's fuse!

00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:35.577
- Get out of here!
- Get out of here!

00:17:18.245 --> 00:17:20.497
What on earth was that?

00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:23.208
That is what I would like to ask.

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:25.794
What is all this?

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.213
{\an8}It does not seem to be a weapon.

00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:29.882
{\an8}Jang Chun-saeng.

00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:32.676
- I ought to--
- I ought to show you this!

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.596
Look at how strong this tree looks.

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:37.639
- My gosh, it worked!
- Mister Jang Chun-saeng?

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:38.557
It worked!

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:45.064
Are these rice puffs?

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.608
"Rice puff"?

00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:52.488
They are rice puffs.

00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:54.740
We came to the right place.

00:17:54.823 --> 00:17:57.868
Why would you say that
about a piece of hangwa, rice confection?

00:17:57.951 --> 00:18:00.079
This isn't just a simple snack.

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:01.997
It's a fusion of cooking and science.

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:03.791
{\an8}It's molecular gastronomy.

00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:05.000
{\an8}"Molecular gastronomy"?

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:13.509
The quantity increased,
but it tastes too bland.

00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:17.262
So you are the insolent Jang Chun-saeng?

00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:20.724
- Do you know who I am? How dare you.
- No, wait.

00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:22.351
Who are you?

00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:23.644
I doubt you are the king.

00:18:23.727 --> 00:18:26.230
Who are you to just barge into my house?

00:18:26.313 --> 00:18:27.397
What did you say?

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:29.316
I am the--

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:32.152
Goodness, Lord Im Song-jae.

00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:35.072
Please do not be so angry.

00:18:35.155 --> 00:18:37.282
Oh, the chaehong inspector?

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:40.202
That is who you are.
No wonder you were so haughty.

00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:44.623
Yes. He is the Chief Royal Secretary.

00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:48.085
You knew that and still threatened us
with a fake cannon?

00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:50.254
- How dare you--
- If

00:18:50.337 --> 00:18:52.923
I had known you were from the palace,

00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:57.636
you would have been showered
with iron balls, not rice.

00:18:57.719 --> 00:18:59.138
How dare you speak so insolently?

00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:01.598
Why do I hear dogs barking here?

00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:03.392
Oh, I see there are two dogs.

00:19:04.434 --> 00:19:06.478
- You insolent--
- Wait.

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:15.237
You have a very keen eye, sir.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.864
I am no sir.

00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:24.538
A puffing machine
that uses heat and pressure.

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:26.790
Maybe this man could…

00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:30.794
Greetings.

00:19:31.378 --> 00:19:34.965
I am Chief Royal Cook Yeon Ji-young
of the royal kitchen.

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:37.384
This truly is strange.

00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:39.386
The Chief Royal Secretary
came all the way here

00:19:39.469 --> 00:19:41.763
with a female chief royal cook
disguised as a man?

00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:45.058
Is it that obvious?

00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:49.021
You won't believe me,

00:19:49.104 --> 00:19:50.480
but it's all true.

00:19:51.064 --> 00:19:54.985
We've come a long way
to ask you for a favor.

00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:58.864
It's an important matter
that concerns the nation's future.

00:19:58.947 --> 00:20:00.365
The nation's future?

00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:02.534
Let the king take care of that.

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.161
Why did you come to me?

00:20:04.244 --> 00:20:07.748
Must I threaten to take your life
to make you see reason?

00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:12.044
So the intruder threatens the homeowner.

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:15.672
You had better leave now.

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:20.219
I can no longer guarantee your safety.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.554
You are truly helpless.

00:20:23.513 --> 00:20:24.806
- Su-hyeok.
- Yes!

00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:27.017
No, please. Come on.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.354
You promised not to be like this.

00:20:33.565 --> 00:20:34.566
Sir.

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:36.568
It's not related to national affairs.

00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:39.196
It's a personal favor
I need to ask of you.

00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:40.822
I warned you.

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:41.823
Wait!

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:42.950
Wait.

00:20:45.535 --> 00:20:48.705
Gosh, you are so impatient.

00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:52.542
Why not hear what she has to say first?

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.557
You know what? Let's forget it.

00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:09.476
Let's get out of here.

00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:11.436
- Come on, hurry!
- Is he out of his mind?

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.021
- You…
- Let's go.

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:15.399
- I will teach you--
- Hurry!

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:17.985
My goodness.

00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:24.449
It's a shame.

00:21:25.575 --> 00:21:27.786
I was going to tell you
how to make the rice puffs taste good.

00:21:27.869 --> 00:21:28.912
"Rice puffs"?

00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:31.498
You mean the rice I popped?

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.418
What about them?

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:36.628
It worked.

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:38.880
Hang on.

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:42.342
Do you really know
how to make this bland thing taste good?

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:45.971
Let's see.

00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:53.854
It's sugar.

00:21:53.937 --> 00:21:55.939
Add some to your next batch of rice.

00:21:56.023 --> 00:21:56.857
Goodbye then.

00:22:08.368 --> 00:22:10.579
What do we do
now that we have been thrown out?

00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:13.582
We should torture him if we must,
so he will make your pot.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.085
Who was it that said
eccentrics had no manners?

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:20.172
What if he really pulled that handle?

00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:21.631
I am sure it was a bluff.

00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:22.674
Your Majesty.

00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:26.762
I have never seen a man like that bluff.

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:29.056
How dare you take that tone
in the presence of His Majesty?

00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:30.474
Presence, my foot.

00:22:30.557 --> 00:22:33.226
We were close to not being present here.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.312
This isn't the time to argue.

00:22:35.395 --> 00:22:38.565
If you want to fight,
you can do so on our way back.

00:22:38.648 --> 00:22:39.691
I won't stop you then.

00:22:40.484 --> 00:22:41.777
My goodness.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.403
I feel utterly humiliated.

00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:22.359
You added the sugar, didn't you?

00:23:26.613 --> 00:23:29.032
- You are still there?
- I can't leave empty-handed.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.743
How is it? Doesn't it taste better?

00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:34.412
The sugar does make it sweeter.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.790
- But it is a bad idea.
- How so?

00:23:36.873 --> 00:23:40.919
I made this machine to double
the rice volume to feed the people.

00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:44.005
But what is the point
if it requires sugar?

00:23:44.631 --> 00:23:46.424
Sugar is too expensive.

00:23:46.508 --> 00:23:49.469
That's all the more reason to help me.

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:51.680
If I win this competition,

00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:54.891
Joseon can import much more sugarcane
at a much cheaper price.

00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:58.687
Then won't everyone
be able to enjoy your rice puffs?

00:24:00.313 --> 00:24:02.649
Is what you said
about the sugarcane really true?

00:24:03.859 --> 00:24:05.235
I'm with the king right--

00:24:05.318 --> 00:24:07.195
I mean…

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:09.865
I came with someone really high up,

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:11.908
so why would I lie to you?

00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:13.702
Are you actually the chief royal cook?

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:19.374
{\an8}Here. Take a look.

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:23.170
CHIEF ROYAL COOK

00:24:24.713 --> 00:24:27.883
Then is he really
the Chief Royal Secretary?

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:30.719
Yes, he is.

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:33.722
Why would you travel
with that treacherous man?

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:37.517
Well, it's a long story.

00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:41.688
What do you need my help with?

00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:43.273
One second.

00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:45.901
Look at this.

00:24:47.068 --> 00:24:48.069
This pressure cooker.

00:24:55.452 --> 00:24:56.703
Thank you.

00:24:58.413 --> 00:25:01.583
What are those two
planning to do alone in there?

00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:04.127
- I ought to--
- No, Your Majesty!

00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:06.254
Please calm down.

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:09.549
We must get what we came for first.

00:25:11.092 --> 00:25:12.844
There seems to be some progress.

00:25:12.928 --> 00:25:13.970
We should wait, Your Majesty.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:19.184
I am already getting frustrated

00:25:19.893 --> 00:25:21.311
when the competition has not even begun.

00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:28.235
This is a pot that traps the steam
from the boiling water.

00:25:28.318 --> 00:25:29.402
Yes, that's right.

00:25:30.904 --> 00:25:33.031
And you can use the weight valve
to release the steam

00:25:33.114 --> 00:25:34.658
when the pressure reaches a certain level.

00:25:34.741 --> 00:25:35.659
{\an8}That's right.

00:25:35.742 --> 00:25:37.285
{\an8}Water boils at 100°C at standard pressure,

00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:39.412
{\an8}but at twice the atmospheric pressure,
it boils at 120°C.

00:25:40.121 --> 00:25:41.122
{\an8}In other words,

00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:43.375
{\an8}it makes it possible
to cook meat so thoroughly

00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:45.293
{\an8}that you can even eat the bone.

00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:48.630
{\an8}I have no clue what you mean,

00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:53.051
but the pot will explode
if the seams weaken in the slightest.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.595
So I must use malleable iron.

00:25:56.263 --> 00:25:59.724
Why am I even giving this any thought?

00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:02.227
Get right to the point.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.020
Why must I make this?

00:26:04.104 --> 00:26:06.147
A few days from now, a cooking competition

00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:08.525
between the Ming and Joseon
will take place at Huijeongdang.

00:26:08.608 --> 00:26:09.985
And in order to win,

00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:11.820
I need this.

00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:14.281
A cook from the Ming, you say?

00:26:14.364 --> 00:26:15.824
They will be tough to beat.

00:26:16.783 --> 00:26:17.659
Can you win?

00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:19.452
With your help, I can.

00:26:20.203 --> 00:26:22.831
We have a better chance
if we have the pot.

00:26:25.709 --> 00:26:27.085
I will not do it.

00:26:27.168 --> 00:26:29.587
I do not want to help those high-ups
who discard people

00:26:30.505 --> 00:26:31.881
when they have done their use.

00:26:33.341 --> 00:26:35.510
Wait, Mister Chun-saeng.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.223
Joseon will have a lot to lose
if we lose this competition.

00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:41.891
The people will suffer too.

00:26:42.726 --> 00:26:45.312
So will you please help me?

00:26:45.895 --> 00:26:47.772
That will not change the world.

00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:50.984
Would Master Jang Yeong-sil

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.486
have agreed with that?

00:26:56.906 --> 00:26:57.907
Do you know my uncle?

00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:01.953
Yes. My uncle might have helped you.

00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:05.123
Only to be used and discarded again.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.209
That is why I will not help.

00:27:10.754 --> 00:27:11.629
You should leave.

00:27:19.346 --> 00:27:20.555
This really isn't easy.

00:27:35.362 --> 00:27:36.363
What did I tell you?

00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:38.573
You cannot reason with him.

00:27:40.825 --> 00:27:42.369
Let us take him to the government office.

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:44.287
We are short on time as it is.

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:46.331
Your Majesty.

00:27:46.414 --> 00:27:49.000
Men like him have nothing
but malice left in them.

00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:50.543
You must appeal to his heart.

00:27:50.627 --> 00:27:54.547
If you use force, the thing he makes
may look fine on the outside,

00:27:54.631 --> 00:27:56.591
but it will most likely be…

00:27:57.175 --> 00:28:00.345
It will most likely be a mess
if you actually try to use it.

00:28:01.096 --> 00:28:02.097
Yes.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.640
Gong-gil's right.

00:28:03.723 --> 00:28:06.476
When Your Majesty forced me to cook,

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:08.019
I only thought of running away.

00:28:08.103 --> 00:28:09.104
What?

00:28:10.271 --> 00:28:12.774
But you have been doing just fine so far,
have you not?

00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:16.069
What if the pressure cooker
is not made right?

00:28:16.152 --> 00:28:17.195
What will you do then?

00:28:17.278 --> 00:28:19.155
Then I will cut off his hands

00:28:19.239 --> 00:28:20.615
and annihilate
three generations of his family.

00:28:21.574 --> 00:28:25.161
Your Majesty,
we must persuade him to make a good pot,

00:28:25.245 --> 00:28:26.454
not threaten him.

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:28.164
What do you suggest we do then?

00:28:28.748 --> 00:28:30.417
I need to appeal to his heart,

00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:33.545
but I can't think of a good idea.

00:28:35.004 --> 00:28:38.258
All of you,
come up with some good ideas by tonight.

00:28:38.758 --> 00:28:39.592
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:28:39.676 --> 00:28:41.344
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:28:42.804 --> 00:28:44.723
{\an8}JAHONGWON

00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:47.809
He left the palace
with the chief royal cook?

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.062
How could he do such a thing?

00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:52.647
Please remain calm, Your Grace.

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:53.857
CHU-WOL
INSPECTOR COURT LADY

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.151
It seems to be for the competition.

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:59.946
More importantly, I have something
to report regarding the jester Gong-gil

00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:01.865
that you told me to look into.

00:29:01.948 --> 00:29:03.450
I learned something

00:29:03.533 --> 00:29:05.910
from the leader of a group
he used to perform with.

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:07.412
What is it?

00:29:07.495 --> 00:29:10.373
Do you, perhaps, remember Ok-dan?

00:29:11.541 --> 00:29:14.836
Do you mean the girl
who once stayed at Jahongwon?

00:29:14.919 --> 00:29:18.840
Yes, Your Grace.
That Ok-dan was Gong-gil's older sister.

00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:24.846
Then

00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:27.932
the reason he is lurking about the palace…

00:29:28.016 --> 00:29:31.060
It must be related to her death.

00:29:31.644 --> 00:29:35.607
Send someone to find out more about him.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:36.775
Yes, Your Grace.

00:29:44.991 --> 00:29:47.952
His Majesty
left the palace with Cook Yeon?

00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:49.120
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

00:29:49.204 --> 00:29:53.166
I do not know what this excursion
could possibly mean,

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.585
but it is a fact that he has left.

00:29:55.668 --> 00:29:58.880
He was never secretive
about his excursions.

00:29:58.963 --> 00:30:00.423
Would there be any meaning to it?

00:30:00.507 --> 00:30:05.220
He would not leave the palace
knowing the Ming envoy is here.

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:06.387
That is right.

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:10.141
His Majesty may be young and immature,
therefore impulsive,

00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:12.811
but he is not that senseless.

00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:15.855
Could it be because of the competition
with the Ming cooks?

00:30:15.939 --> 00:30:18.983
Do you believe he left the palace
to prepare for that?

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:22.278
It cannot be
that His Majesty has developed feelings

00:30:22.362 --> 00:30:24.572
for the chief royal cook, could it?

00:30:25.573 --> 00:30:27.325
Watch what you say.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:05.363
ROYAL KITCHEN

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:24.132
It tastes good, but it is nothing special.

00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:26.634
I guess our chief royal cook is right.

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:29.053
It seems cooking the ogolgye
with our usual cauldron will not do.

00:31:29.137 --> 00:31:30.889
When will she be back?

00:31:30.972 --> 00:31:35.226
I cut and cleaned the short ribs
or whatever they are.

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.270
It would seem we are ready
for the first round, would it not?

00:31:37.353 --> 00:31:40.106
Did you store the gochogaru and gochojang?

00:31:40.189 --> 00:31:41.399
Of course.

00:31:41.482 --> 00:31:42.692
Cook Min stored them safely

00:31:42.775 --> 00:31:45.445
in the grain storage in Saongwon,
Office of Royal Meals.

00:31:45.528 --> 00:31:47.530
What about the duck she asked to get?

00:31:48.114 --> 00:31:48.948
Bong-sik!

00:31:49.949 --> 00:31:51.409
Bong-sik.

00:31:51.492 --> 00:31:53.453
You need to come with me quickly.

00:31:54.454 --> 00:31:56.039
What is this about?

00:31:56.831 --> 00:31:58.791
Cook Maeng is acting strangely.

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:01.753
How so? Is his anxiety flaring up?

00:32:01.836 --> 00:32:03.588
Again! Do it again!

00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:04.923
Goodness, that scared me.

00:32:12.972 --> 00:32:13.806
Stop.

00:32:17.143 --> 00:32:18.645
If you chop them like this,

00:32:18.728 --> 00:32:21.856
are you telling me to use them
or throw them out?

00:32:22.523 --> 00:32:23.483
I am sorry.

00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:25.526
I will do it again.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.320
Chop according to my pace.

00:32:30.907 --> 00:32:32.951
How can you still be so bad at chopping?

00:32:33.034 --> 00:32:35.203
Go and sharpen the knife again!

00:32:36.329 --> 00:32:37.163
Move.

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:46.464
Goodness, what is with Cook Maeng?

00:32:46.547 --> 00:32:48.549
He used to be so nice to her.

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:49.717
What got into him?

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:51.427
He is being quite strange.

00:32:51.511 --> 00:32:53.805
He is much stricter
than when he taught me.

00:32:53.888 --> 00:32:57.684
He is sensitive
because his life is on the line.

00:32:59.102 --> 00:33:02.355
Why is he teaching Maid Seo anyway?

00:33:06.526 --> 00:33:08.444
KONG WENLI
MASTER OF KUNG FU CUISINE

00:33:10.738 --> 00:33:13.449
TANG BAILONG
MASTER OF SICHUAN CUISINE

00:33:15.952 --> 00:33:16.828
Good.

00:33:17.787 --> 00:33:22.083
I have not seen you this passionate
in a long time.

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:26.045
Our pride as cooks
depends on this competition.

00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:28.047
Though there is nothing for us to gain
from winning,

00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:30.591
losing would be
an indescribable humiliation.

00:33:31.175 --> 00:33:33.970
We shall not look down on a small nation
for its modest size,

00:33:34.554 --> 00:33:36.472
nor be arrogant merely because
we come from a great nation.

00:33:36.556 --> 00:33:38.391
There is an idiom that goes,

00:33:38.474 --> 00:33:40.727
"One cannot be a good cook

00:33:42.145 --> 00:33:44.063
if their skill comes before their virtue."

00:33:44.147 --> 00:33:45.940
I always remember your teaching.

00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:48.192
Always remain humble

00:33:48.276 --> 00:33:49.986
as we show them

00:33:50.069 --> 00:33:53.114
what the greatest cooks of Ming can do.

00:33:53.197 --> 00:33:54.574
Yes, Brother Tang.

00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:57.744
Anyway,

00:33:58.995 --> 00:34:01.956
where is Ya Feixiu?

00:34:02.749 --> 00:34:04.459
{\an8}Well, look who is here.

00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:06.878
You are one of the Ming cooks,
are you not?

00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:08.671
What brings you here?

00:34:10.173 --> 00:34:13.676
Before I explain, please accept this.

00:34:21.684 --> 00:34:23.811
These are chopi, Sichuan pepper.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:26.898
{\an8}HUAJIAO: NUMBING, SPICY SEASONING
MADE FROM THE FRUIT OF PRICKLY ASH

00:34:26.981 --> 00:34:30.818
{\an8}These are not just any chopi,
but Sichuan's best, huajiao.

00:34:32.111 --> 00:34:36.449
Why did you bring me
something so valuable?

00:34:36.532 --> 00:34:42.622
There is something
I wish to exchange with this.

00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:49.253
The weather is not on our side either.

00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:54.175
{\an8}It would be dreadful
if His Majesty were to catch a cold.

00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:56.844
I am drenched already.

00:35:00.181 --> 00:35:01.307
Commander,

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:04.268
do not just stand there and join us here.

00:35:04.352 --> 00:35:05.520
You are getting soaked in the rain.

00:35:06.562 --> 00:35:08.022
Do not mind me.

00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:10.650
You are wet
because you are standing there.

00:35:10.733 --> 00:35:14.529
Why go overbroad
when you can stand guard under the roof?

00:35:18.491 --> 00:35:20.409
On a rainy day like this,

00:35:20.493 --> 00:35:23.579
some pajeon, scallion pancakes,
with makgeolli, rice wine,

00:35:23.663 --> 00:35:26.499
would raise my spirits.

00:35:28.167 --> 00:35:29.460
Do you not agree, Your Majesty?

00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:31.003
Pajeon, you say?

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:35.174
The thought alone pleases me.

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.222
Yes, pajeon.

00:35:41.764 --> 00:35:44.142
Your Majesty, where was
Master Jang Yeong-sil's hometown again?

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:45.977
How would I know that?

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.816
Based on Jang Chun-saeng's accent,

00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:55.444
I would say he is from Dongnae,
Busan Port.

00:35:55.528 --> 00:35:57.697
So he's from Busan, right?

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:58.614
Yes.

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:00.700
That's what I thought as well.

00:36:08.624 --> 00:36:09.584
What is it?

00:36:11.085 --> 00:36:14.255
There might be a way
to persuade Mister Chun-saeng.

00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:18.301
Let's go buy some ingredients first.

00:36:18.384 --> 00:36:20.136
There's no point if the rain stops,

00:36:20.219 --> 00:36:23.514
- so we must hurry.
- What? My goodness.

00:36:29.312 --> 00:36:30.688
They left at last.

00:36:31.939 --> 00:36:33.858
I made more rice puffs,

00:36:33.941 --> 00:36:35.568
but it does not taste good
without the sugar.

00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:38.696
It does not fill me at all.

00:36:40.406 --> 00:36:41.365
Darn it.

00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:52.835
This needs to be cleaned too.

00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:09.810
What are you waiting for?

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:11.896
You have no idea how to cook this.

00:37:11.979 --> 00:37:15.524
Dongnae pajeon batter has to be thick.

00:37:15.608 --> 00:37:17.568
- Otherwise, it's a no-go.
- What is not going where?

00:37:17.652 --> 00:37:20.154
You have to lay out
the scallions like this

00:37:20.238 --> 00:37:21.864
and cook them thoroughly first.

00:37:21.948 --> 00:37:24.367
It's time to start fanning.

00:37:25.243 --> 00:37:26.953
Send the smell far away.

00:37:34.377 --> 00:37:36.087
It smells absolutely amazing.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.256
It is driving me crazy, Your Majesty.

00:37:47.223 --> 00:37:49.183
You're doing a really great job
with the fan.

00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:50.851
You're doing great, Su-hyeok and Gong-gil.

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:51.769
Good.

00:37:52.687 --> 00:37:55.690
You're doing so well!
That's it. Fan harder now.

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:57.275
- Harder?
- Yes.

00:37:57.358 --> 00:37:59.819
- Get out of the way.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:37:59.902 --> 00:38:01.737
- No, Your Majesty.
- Move.

00:38:03.906 --> 00:38:05.533
I apologize, Your Majesty.

00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:12.081
My gosh, Your Majesty.

00:38:12.164 --> 00:38:15.751
It feels like the mountain breeze.

00:38:16.335 --> 00:38:18.587
- Do not speak.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:38:41.193 --> 00:38:42.695
What is this smell?

00:38:42.778 --> 00:38:44.155
My word.

00:38:44.238 --> 00:38:45.865
Something smells amazing.

00:38:46.907 --> 00:38:48.868
What is it?

00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:57.084
He's here.

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:11.557
Wait, Mister Chun-saeng.

00:39:12.058 --> 00:39:13.142
What?

00:39:13.225 --> 00:39:15.102
Well, His Majesty…

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:18.898
I mean, the Chief Royal Secretary

00:39:18.981 --> 00:39:21.817
wanted pajeon and makgeolli
as it was raining,

00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:24.737
so we made a lot of pajeon.

00:39:25.529 --> 00:39:27.531
Would you like some?

00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:31.494
Pajeon is your hometown food, isn't it?

00:39:31.577 --> 00:39:32.745
Yes, my hometown…

00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:35.831
Forget it.

00:39:35.915 --> 00:39:37.416
Let him be.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.543
He need not eat if he does not want to.

00:39:40.086 --> 00:39:41.337
Go on and cut the pajeon.

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:46.759
Let me just…

00:39:49.428 --> 00:39:50.471
Hey, mister.

00:39:51.514 --> 00:39:52.807
Do not be like that.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.393
Come over and have some with us.

00:39:56.227 --> 00:40:00.815
Will you look at the golden-brown pajeon?

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:02.358
Is it not beautiful?

00:40:02.441 --> 00:40:04.777
Come closer.

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:05.778
Darn it.

00:40:05.861 --> 00:40:08.531
- Come on.
- Goodness me.

00:40:08.614 --> 00:40:10.032
Try some.

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:33.806
Look at him just stuffing away.

00:40:34.306 --> 00:40:36.725
- Do not mind me and eat.
- Yes.

00:41:05.212 --> 00:41:06.964
This taste!

00:41:19.351 --> 00:41:20.728
You might get an upset stomach.

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:21.729
Here.

00:41:21.812 --> 00:41:24.273
There's a lot, so eat slowly.

00:41:26.942 --> 00:41:28.444
I feel much better now.

00:41:28.527 --> 00:41:31.530
My gosh.
This is the taste of my childhood.

00:41:31.614 --> 00:41:34.867
It tastes like what I had
at a village feast as a child.

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:35.993
How did you make this?

00:41:36.076 --> 00:41:38.329
My father is also from Busan.

00:41:38.412 --> 00:41:39.497
Busan Port?

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.749
Yes, that's right. Busan Port.

00:41:41.832 --> 00:41:44.543
- No wonder.
- Have some more.

00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:53.761
You told me yesterday

00:41:54.303 --> 00:41:58.682
that Master Jang Yeong-sil
was used and then discarded.

00:41:59.225 --> 00:42:02.853
But just like how you remember
the taste of your childhood,

00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:07.399
people will never forget him.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.070
Thanks to him,

00:42:11.153 --> 00:42:14.156
people can tell the exact time…

00:42:17.326 --> 00:42:19.453
and they can observe
and read the stars too.

00:42:22.915 --> 00:42:23.832
Mister Chun-saeng.

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:27.545
This might sound strange,

00:42:27.628 --> 00:42:28.754
but to be honest,

00:42:29.547 --> 00:42:31.715
I'm not from this time period.

00:42:32.258 --> 00:42:35.302
It's a complicated story, but it's true.

00:42:36.178 --> 00:42:40.808
Anyway, the reason
I'm so involved in this…

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:45.980
is because I love to cook.

00:42:46.939 --> 00:42:51.402
It makes me really happy when I see
the satisfied look on the faces of people

00:42:51.485 --> 00:42:52.736
who enjoy my food.

00:42:54.196 --> 00:42:55.447
So through this competition,

00:42:55.531 --> 00:42:59.159
I want to show the Ming cooks
my food as well as Korea's…

00:43:00.953 --> 00:43:03.080
I mean, I want to show them
the taste of Joseon.

00:43:03.163 --> 00:43:08.002
So could you help us by doing
what you love, Mister Chun-saeng?

00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:10.504
Let's win this cooking competition

00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:14.508
and get the Ming sugarcane
so everyone can enjoy

00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:17.136
your delicious rice puffs at any time.

00:43:17.219 --> 00:43:20.306
I'm sure that'll make you happy too.

00:43:21.015 --> 00:43:22.433
For everyone's sake,

00:43:22.933 --> 00:43:24.226
I beg of you.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:25.185
Please?

00:43:25.811 --> 00:43:27.187
Please.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.576
I will make it.

00:43:40.659 --> 00:43:41.577
You will?

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:45.164
Do you truly mean that?

00:43:45.247 --> 00:43:47.207
I am not doing it for you,
so do not get excited.

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:50.753
- How dare you--
- Just stop saying that already.

00:43:51.962 --> 00:43:53.130
Thank you.

00:43:53.213 --> 00:43:54.840
Thank you so much!

00:43:55.424 --> 00:43:56.467
Thank you too.

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:00.804
I never thought I would taste this again,

00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:03.432
but you made it for me.

00:44:05.392 --> 00:44:07.061
I missed the taste of my home…

00:44:09.104 --> 00:44:10.314
my whole life.

00:44:12.733 --> 00:44:13.609
Next time,

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:16.195
I'll tell you how to make
caramel rice puffs.

00:44:17.279 --> 00:44:18.405
"Kernel" rice puffs?

00:44:26.372 --> 00:44:28.040
So are you headed to Danyang?

00:44:28.123 --> 00:44:30.584
Yes. I need some ingredients from there.

00:44:31.293 --> 00:44:34.171
Assist him well
so the pot is ready upon our return.

00:44:34.254 --> 00:44:35.172
Yes, Your…

00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:39.218
My lord.

00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:41.303
Do not slack off

00:44:41.387 --> 00:44:42.429
and work hard.

00:44:43.347 --> 00:44:45.015
We'll be late. Let's go.

00:44:46.225 --> 00:44:47.101
I wish you well, my lord.

00:44:49.144 --> 00:44:50.187
Here.

00:44:53.107 --> 00:44:53.982
Let's go.

00:44:57.611 --> 00:45:00.322
Here is the mold.

00:45:00.406 --> 00:45:01.448
Shall we begin?

00:45:02.825 --> 00:45:04.076
Here goes.

00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:23.929
What is this?

00:45:24.012 --> 00:45:26.056
It looks like ginseng.

00:45:26.682 --> 00:45:27.516
What?

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.812
This is wild ginseng, Your Majesty!

00:45:36.984 --> 00:45:38.610
What are you doing?

00:45:38.694 --> 00:45:39.736
Have you forgotten?

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.905
Everything on this land belongs to me.

00:45:41.989 --> 00:45:44.867
This is even more so because I found it.

00:45:57.004 --> 00:45:58.422
It should be done by tomorrow.

00:45:58.505 --> 00:45:59.923
That is good to hear.

00:46:00.007 --> 00:46:02.176
The Chief Royal Secretary and cook
will be back by then.

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:03.177
It is perfect.

00:46:04.303 --> 00:46:05.387
Let us hurry!

00:46:16.523 --> 00:46:17.941
What is that?

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:20.277
I have not seen this oil before.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:25.073
It is a secret weapon
with which we will win the first round.

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:29.077
Where did you get this from?

00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:30.204
Trust me.

00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:34.166
You have put me in charge
of the dish for the first round.

00:46:34.249 --> 00:46:36.251
I will not let you down.

00:46:36.335 --> 00:46:38.504
Do not take risks
with unfamiliar ingredients.

00:46:38.587 --> 00:46:39.630
Once before--

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:44.551
Ya Feixiu.

00:46:45.761 --> 00:46:47.179
I trust you.

00:46:49.515 --> 00:46:52.434
The day of the competition is approaching.

00:46:52.518 --> 00:46:53.477
Indeed.

00:46:58.273 --> 00:47:02.027
I am looking forward
to the skills of the Ming cooks.

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:03.862
You will see for yourself in due time.

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:12.204
Let us speak in your language.

00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.459
Yes, we can do that.

00:47:17.543 --> 00:47:21.421
We have boarded the same ship already.

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.632
Let us be clear

00:47:24.633 --> 00:47:26.093
about what we are giving and receiving.

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:27.886
Of course we will.

00:47:28.637 --> 00:47:32.558
Your cooks will most definitely win
the competition.

00:47:33.058 --> 00:47:38.564
It is possible the competition
might not happen at all.

00:47:38.647 --> 00:47:40.732
What do you mean by that?

00:47:41.316 --> 00:47:42.484
The chief royal cook

00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:46.572
left the palace to obtain something
for the competition.

00:47:46.655 --> 00:47:47.614
But you see,

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:53.412
a lot of dangerous things
happen outside the palace.

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:58.875
I wonder if we will all just end up

00:47:58.959 --> 00:48:02.838
indulging in the delicacies
of the Ming that day.

00:48:03.964 --> 00:48:05.632
Get a good night's rest,

00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:08.594
{\an8}and take your time coming to Huijeongdang
by the thirteenth hour tomorrow.

00:48:09.303 --> 00:48:13.265
{\an8}It seems my cooks might be
a little disappointed.

00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:22.357
Make sure to thoroughly prepare
the ingredients for tomorrow.

00:48:22.441 --> 00:48:23.525
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:26.403
Oh dear.

00:48:27.487 --> 00:48:30.616
The competition, at last, begins tomorrow.

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:33.785
Will the chief royal cook return on time?

00:48:33.869 --> 00:48:35.579
I am sure she will.

00:48:35.662 --> 00:48:37.414
Let us go and get a good night's sleep.

00:48:38.206 --> 00:48:43.712
I feel a bit uneasy leaving only Cook Min
and Cook Sim behind.

00:48:43.795 --> 00:48:47.424
Why worry when we even prepared
the late-night snacks with them?

00:48:47.507 --> 00:48:49.551
By the way,

00:48:50.135 --> 00:48:52.721
why are you giving Maid Seo
such a hard time?

00:48:53.513 --> 00:48:55.057
The chief royal cook is not even here.

00:48:55.641 --> 00:48:57.351
Do not be too hard on her.

00:48:57.851 --> 00:49:00.896
I saw that you gave her
a lot of work again today.

00:49:09.321 --> 00:49:12.783
If she is of no help here,
she should leave voluntarily.

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.496
How could he be so heartless?

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.539
And why is he so fast? Wait, Cook Maeng.

00:49:20.123 --> 00:49:21.708
Cook Maeng. My goodness.

00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:23.502
Do you not hear me?

00:49:23.585 --> 00:49:25.879
Why are you following me
when we are going different ways anyway?

00:49:25.962 --> 00:49:27.714
I called you so many…

00:49:37.724 --> 00:49:38.600
What is that?

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:45.065
Who are you?

00:49:45.732 --> 00:49:49.277
Give this to your king immediately.

00:49:53.323 --> 00:49:55.325
The chief royal cook is in danger.

00:49:55.909 --> 00:49:57.119
Hurry.

00:50:00.288 --> 00:50:02.624
That grey hair.

00:50:02.708 --> 00:50:06.002
The long grey hair.
He is with the Ming envoy, is he not?

00:50:06.086 --> 00:50:08.588
That is impossible. He spoke our language.

00:50:09.089 --> 00:50:11.842
Did you see that?

00:50:11.925 --> 00:50:15.220
He was hiding a dagger underneath.

00:50:17.597 --> 00:50:19.599
What does it say on the paper?

00:50:23.395 --> 00:50:25.522
There is nothing on it.

00:50:30.652 --> 00:50:32.028
- Greetings, Chief Eunuch.
- Greetings.

00:50:32.654 --> 00:50:35.741
Why are you here at this hour?

00:50:35.824 --> 00:50:38.285
We met a mysterious man
on our way out of the palace.

00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:40.746
He told me to give this to His Majesty.

00:50:41.413 --> 00:50:44.958
His face was covered by a black mask,
and he bore a terrifying presence.

00:50:45.041 --> 00:50:46.668
He did not seem like an ordinary man.

00:50:48.044 --> 00:50:48.962
Very well.

00:50:49.546 --> 00:50:50.464
You may go now.

00:50:50.547 --> 00:50:51.840
- Yes, Chief Eunuch.
- Yes, Chief Eunuch.

00:50:58.221 --> 00:50:59.389
What is this?

00:51:21.703 --> 00:51:24.289
There are those who are targeting
the chief royal cook.

00:51:24.372 --> 00:51:27.667
She might not last another day,
so you must hurry.

00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:28.794
Chief Eunuch.

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:32.130
Do you know how far away
Jang Chun-saeng lives?

00:51:32.714 --> 00:51:35.801
If you take a fast horse,
you will arrive by dawn tomorrow.

00:51:35.884 --> 00:51:37.719
Tell them to ready the horses.

00:51:37.803 --> 00:51:39.179
- Hurry.
- Of course.

00:51:52.651 --> 00:51:53.902
Your Majesty.

00:51:53.985 --> 00:51:56.738
Please stay safe until I reach you.

00:52:02.035 --> 00:52:05.080
{\an8}DAY OF THE COMPETITION
MYOSI (BETWEEN 5 AND 7 A.M.)

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.597
It works. We did it, sir.

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:26.226
Come forth!

00:52:29.938 --> 00:52:31.064
Welcome back, Your Majesty.

00:52:45.745 --> 00:52:47.205
Only kill the girl.

00:52:53.461 --> 00:52:55.422
You are greatly skilled indeed.

00:52:58.258 --> 00:53:00.760
We stayed up all night to make it.

00:53:02.929 --> 00:53:04.347
I made it strong enough

00:53:04.431 --> 00:53:05.974
so that it withstands
high heat and pressure.

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:10.061
Cook Yeon, take this chance
to show them what you are capable of.

00:53:10.812 --> 00:53:12.105
Thank you.

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.857
Thank you so much, Mister Chun-saeng.

00:53:14.566 --> 00:53:15.984
It's perfect!

00:53:17.193 --> 00:53:19.696
I will reward you again at a later time.

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.281
Good work.

00:53:21.907 --> 00:53:24.200
Now, let us return to the palace.

00:53:24.284 --> 00:53:25.869
- Yes. We shall go.
- Oh, right.

00:53:25.952 --> 00:53:28.330
I wish I could cook you a meal.

00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:30.165
Do not worry.

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:31.541
Do visit again.

00:53:54.814 --> 00:53:56.232
We are in trouble. Assassins are coming!

00:53:56.316 --> 00:53:58.026
What? Assassins?

00:53:58.109 --> 00:53:59.194
What do you mean?

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:07.452
I hung a bell for every ten steps.
Seeing that they are coming at this speed…

00:54:07.535 --> 00:54:10.288
They are well-trained men.
You must get away, Your Majesty.

00:54:10.372 --> 00:54:11.247
"Your Majesty"?

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:15.126
I'm sorry. We were just…

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.922
You can explain later.

00:54:19.673 --> 00:54:20.674
You must get away.

00:54:21.257 --> 00:54:22.717
Who on earth are they?

00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:24.928
What do we do, Your Majesty?

00:54:25.011 --> 00:54:26.054
Hide behind me.

00:54:29.516 --> 00:54:31.601
Open the gate on my signal.

00:54:31.685 --> 00:54:33.770
- Okay.
- We should be locking up.

00:54:33.853 --> 00:54:35.063
Why open the gate?

00:54:35.146 --> 00:54:36.356
Trust me, Your Majesty.

00:54:55.417 --> 00:54:56.376
Now!

00:55:23.028 --> 00:55:25.030
- Cook Yeon, run! Hurry!
- Okay!

00:55:25.113 --> 00:55:27.073
- Your Majesty, let's go.
- Follow me.

00:56:08.573 --> 00:56:09.574
No!

00:56:10.408 --> 00:56:12.619
- No!
- What are you doing? We must go.

00:56:22.295 --> 00:56:25.131
Gong-gil!
Take Cook Yeon out the back door!

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:26.424
I cannot use the weapons now!

00:56:27.008 --> 00:56:28.593
We went through so much
for the pressure cooker.

00:56:28.676 --> 00:56:29.803
Hurry!

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:32.514
Cook Yeon, I will bring it to you
by the time you need it.

00:56:32.597 --> 00:56:35.058
So go now, or we will all die!

00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:36.643
Okay.

00:56:41.815 --> 00:56:42.690
Come this way!

00:56:51.533 --> 00:56:52.617
Let us all die together!

00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:59.624
Go after the girl!

00:57:11.052 --> 00:57:12.470
Why, darn it.

00:57:25.525 --> 00:57:26.443
Your Majesty.

00:57:27.819 --> 00:57:30.405
I will hold them off while you get away.

00:57:30.488 --> 00:57:32.240
- Very well.
- Stay safe.

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:34.576
Ensure His Majesty's safety.

00:57:36.035 --> 00:57:37.120
We must go.

00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:13.531
Your Majesty,
it would be best to part ways here.

00:58:13.615 --> 00:58:14.949
I will stall them.

00:58:15.033 --> 00:58:16.034
Very well.

00:58:16.117 --> 00:58:17.202
We will go this way.

00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:18.870
Thank you, Gong-gil.

00:58:18.953 --> 00:58:20.246
- Go, now!
- Let us go.

00:58:24.042 --> 00:58:25.460
Over here!

00:58:32.342 --> 00:58:33.343
Come at me.

00:58:52.737 --> 00:58:54.322
No.

00:58:58.868 --> 00:59:00.411
Who sent you?

00:59:11.923 --> 00:59:13.758
Your Majesty!

00:59:19.305 --> 00:59:20.807
Your Majesty…

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:22.767
Your shoulder is bleeding.

00:59:23.726 --> 00:59:25.186
There is no need to make a fuss.

00:59:25.812 --> 00:59:26.729
It will not kill me.

00:59:56.342 --> 00:59:57.302
Who is it?

00:59:57.385 --> 00:59:58.469
Who sent you?

01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:14.819
Cook Yeon!

01:00:14.902 --> 01:00:16.195
Are you all right?

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:17.905
Wake up.

01:00:24.537 --> 01:00:25.747
Open your eyes.

01:00:26.497 --> 01:00:27.540
Your Majesty.

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:36.507
She seems to have fainted.

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:39.802
Please forgive me for being so late,
Your Majesty.

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:42.388
Thank you, Song-jae.

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:54.817
Will you slow down?

01:00:56.527 --> 01:00:57.528
Are you well?

01:00:58.196 --> 01:00:59.822
Yes, Your Majesty. I am well.

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:03.618
He would have died if it were not for me.

01:01:05.119 --> 01:01:06.287
Is that so?

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:09.123
Su-hyeok is the best swordsman
in all of Joseon.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:13.795
Well, I guess he rolled down a slope then.

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:18.424
I guess even the best swordsman
cannot beat a slope.

01:01:22.303 --> 01:01:24.931
Is the chief royal cook all right?

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:28.017
It seems the shock made her faint.

01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:30.728
I am glad she was not badly hurt
right before the competition.

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:34.774
These assassins
were unlike the ones from before.

01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:37.777
- Is that so?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:40.154
These men have received military training.

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:42.198
- Military training?
- Their movement was coordinated,

01:01:42.281 --> 01:01:45.201
and when caught,
they took their own lives to stay silent.

01:01:46.452 --> 01:01:49.455
That means this attack was not conducted
for a personal reason.

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:50.581
Your Majesty.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:53.084
They must be troops
sent by those with treacherous intentions.

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:56.838
The pressure cooker.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.636
Are you all right?

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:10.351
Is everyone all right?

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:12.478
I am just fine.

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:14.605
Do not worry.

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:16.023
Everyone is safe.

01:02:16.941 --> 01:02:18.484
I'm so glad.

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:21.904
I was scared to death.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:27.785
Your Majesty, it's still
the day of the competition, right?

01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:29.078
Indeed.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:31.706
But you cannot compete
with an injured hand.

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.041
I'm fine.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:36.002
- We must hurry back.
- But…

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:38.212
That pot is missing its lid.

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:41.924
Mister Chun-saeng said he'd bring the lid.

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:43.092
I believe in him.

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:46.345
We must hurry back. Let's go. Come on.

01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:52.518
Pathetic fools.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:55.188
How am I to trust them with anything
when they fail each time?

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.661
In any case,

01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:14.582
the competition will not go your way,
Your Majesty.

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:19.086
{\an8}HUIJEONGDANG

01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:45.196
Where are you, miss?

01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:03.464
{\an8}It is almost the thirteenth hour,

01:04:03.548 --> 01:04:06.175
but neither the king

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:09.637
nor the chief royal cook is present.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.014
I do not know how to take this.

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:16.060
He asked where the king
and the chief royal cook are.

01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:19.230
Chief Eunuch.

01:04:19.313 --> 01:04:23.860
Inform the chief envoy that His Majesty
will arrive a little late.

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:25.820
Yes, my lord.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.053
Are you certain you are unharmed?

01:04:53.764 --> 01:04:55.808
I feel weak and nauseous.

01:04:57.059 --> 01:05:00.104
I must be feeling sick
from being on a horse.

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:05.610
Is it that you want an apology from me
for giving you a hard time?

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:08.571
Of course not.

01:05:09.822 --> 01:05:13.200
I do want to thank you
for what you did earlier.

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:16.579
You were really cool.

01:05:19.957 --> 01:05:22.668
Well, yes. I am good with a sword.

01:05:24.712 --> 01:05:26.839
I am putting all of you
through a great deal of trouble.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.176
If only I had not suggested a competition…

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:34.805
Why are you acting out of character?

01:05:35.973 --> 01:05:37.141
I'm fine.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:39.936
We should hurry.

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:40.895
Come on.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:52.740
I am sorry, Cook Yeon,

01:05:53.991 --> 01:05:55.242
for giving you a hard time.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:05:59.538
We have reached the agreed-upon time.

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:02.667
Joseon has long been known
as the eastern land of courtesy.

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:06.170
However,
this is inappropriate beyond belief.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.515
The chief envoy wonders

01:06:17.598 --> 01:06:20.434
if the king and the chief royal cook
ran away to avoid the competition.

01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:23.145
How rude of them to utter such words!

01:06:25.564 --> 01:06:28.192
What do we do if His Majesty

01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:31.570
does not appear before the time is up?

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:33.239
Let us wait.

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:38.452
It is truly inappropriate
to keep the chief envoy waiting.

01:06:39.704 --> 01:06:42.540
How about we begin the competition?

01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:53.300
It is the thirteenth hour!

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.553
It is exactly the thirteenth hour.

01:06:55.636 --> 01:06:57.722
We shall begin the competition.

01:06:59.223 --> 01:07:01.892
The cooks from each nation,
please step forward.

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:09.734
Cook Eom.

01:07:11.485 --> 01:07:13.404
Oh no, Cook Eom.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:15.865
What do we do now?

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:22.371
My lord.

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:25.082
This cannot be allowed.

01:07:25.624 --> 01:07:27.293
What do you mean?

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:29.211
We still have until the fifteenth hour.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:32.715
{\an8}I will not begin until then.

01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:35.051
What do you mean?

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:39.013
My lord, it is time to show
how merciful our great nation is.

01:07:39.096 --> 01:07:41.766
What did you say?

01:07:51.817 --> 01:07:55.029
All right, do as you wish. We shall wait.

01:07:55.112 --> 01:07:56.947
Let us begin at the fifteenth hour.

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:59.158
At the Ming's request,

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:01.619
the competition will begin
at the fifteenth hour.

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:05.748
- What a relief.
- My goodness.

01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:09.502
Why is Cook Yeon taking so long?

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:10.586
I do not know.

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:24.975
It is the fifteenth hour!

01:08:35.152 --> 01:08:38.489
- It is over.
- What should we do, Cook Eom?

01:08:40.407 --> 01:08:42.451
It might be better that she does not come.

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:46.122
How can you say that?

01:08:56.882 --> 01:08:57.967
They are here.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:22.867
We are here.

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:24.660
Now, should I show them what I can do?

01:09:27.913 --> 01:09:29.248
Your Majesty.

01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:31.083
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.294
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty.

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:34.920
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:18.631
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:20.716
{\an8}The theme of the first dish is…

01:10:20.799 --> 01:10:23.135
{\an8}I must prepare a meat dish
they've never seen before.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:24.845
{\an8}A taste that doesn't exist in this era.

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:26.263
{\an8}I am sure you remember.

01:10:26.347 --> 01:10:27.640
{\an8}We must lose at all costs.

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:28.891
{\an8}I have bad news.

01:10:28.974 --> 01:10:30.476
{\an8}The gochogaru is gone.

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:31.977
{\an8}Where did you get this red oil?

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.146
{\an8}Is it an ingredient you brought?

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.440
{\an8}What were you thinking?

01:10:36.523 --> 01:10:38.150
{\an8}His Majesty and the chief royal cook

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:41.362
{\an8}will not be able to avoid
this arrow of fate.

01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:43.197
{\an8}I don't want to lose either.

01:10:44.698 --> 01:10:47.201
{\an8}I will announce the result
of the first round.

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:55.334
