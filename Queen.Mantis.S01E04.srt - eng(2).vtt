00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.557
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.977
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES.

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.400
{\an8}Woongsan was a mining town.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.946
{\an8}There, each day,
I lived a powerless existence.

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:15.950
{\an8}Those who lost their jobs
after the mine shut down

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:17.994
{\an8}turned to the bottle for solace every day.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.329
{\an8}MINERS UNITE FOR SURVIVAL

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.081
{\an8}Some even left in a hurry

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:23.583
{\an8}in search of another life.

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:27.712
{\an8}The remaining miners in company housing,
awaiting their eviction allowance,

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:30.298
{\an8}fell into two groups.

00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:32.467
{\an8}Those with money drank and played cards.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.135
{\an8}Those without lashed out,

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:36.888
and took it out on their wives and kids.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:40.433
The small town

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:42.435
with the string of murders…

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:44.771
- Sir!
- …and the police who held the line.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:46.940
- You need to calm down.
- Police?

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:48.399
- Calm down.
- Do you know me?

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:50.568
- Calm down.
- This doesn't concern you!

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:52.695
- Please calm down.
- Mind your own business.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:53.780
Are you all right?

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.490
- Hey.
- Come on now, sir.

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:57.742
- Please take a breath.
- Hey.

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:58.952
Do not resort to violence.

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:00.620
- Use your words.
- Did you report me?

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:03.873
- You should not resort to violence.
- Tell me. Why would you call the police?

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.251
Come on now. Grab your jacket.

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:07.836
I'll kill you, damn it.

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.462
Grab your jacket.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.923
- Go inside. Go on!
- Why I…

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:13.007
Stop staring!

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:14.759
Get your ass in here!

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:30.817
I am Corporal Choi Jung-ho
from Woongsan Police Station.

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.611
If you need help,

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.947
just blink for me.

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:38.700
I will help you.

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.376
What are you doing? Get your ass in here.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.712
Ma'am.

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:53.172
What are you doing with that damn cop?

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:55.508
Get your ass up here right now.

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.428
Do I need to beat more sense into you?

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.518
Every day as I patrolled,

00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:09.647
all I could do
was send out signals to the people.

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:13.359
"The police are out here."

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.487
"The police are nearby."

00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:20.950
Even when I knew
such warnings were useless,

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:22.869
I could not stop.

00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:25.830
That town was completely enshrouded

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:28.124
in the air of criminality.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.169
I could not leave that place behind.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.881
Before I knew it,
that hell had seeped into my soul

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:35.965
as I watched

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.219
another day pass me by.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.847
Have you finally come to your senses?

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:46.309
You should thank me
for not using hot water.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:47.393
Get in there!

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.689
How dare you show such disrespect
to your noble husband?

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:54.567
Have I knocked some sense into you now?

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.653
Have I? Well?

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:57.779
Tell me.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:54.877
He thought there'd be

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.089
a well around
because we were in the countryside.

00:04:58.172 --> 00:05:00.049
And even at the hospital.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.051
What is he? The god of investigations?

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:03.761
How are all his guesses right?

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.055
He does get it right every time.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.391
I'm not the only one
who finds it weird, right?

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:12.854
He must have a secret…

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:14.981
Seo Gu-wan.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.401
Could he have cajoled
all this intel out of him?

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:20.528
Seo knew about
Jeong I-shin's first murder.

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:23.948
My goodness. That must be it.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.283
But why?

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:28.619
He knew about the hospital and the well.

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.622
He knew about everything
but just acted like he didn't?

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:40.256
No. That's not it.

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:42.300
It's not, but…

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.386
Why is this bugging me so much?

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:24.300
Eun-ae.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:27.553
What are you doing?

00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:32.141
You shouldn't be in here. Come out! Now!

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.192
Hey, Su-yeol.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:42.777
Yes.

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:45.655
When she was young,

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:48.699
we lost her mother.
It was just the two of us.

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.869
We didn't have the best relationship.

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:54.455
We barely talked

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.249
and she was never home.

00:06:57.166 --> 00:07:00.044
She couldn't wait to leave home.

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.304
What's wrong? Are you hungry?

00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:14.642
That red. Who's that signal for?

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.565
What signal?

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:24.026
This.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:25.987
You wore it yesterday.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.282
Did you spill something on it?
Why would you wash it after one wear?

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:31.826
I-shin.

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:34.662
I'm not that narrow-minded.

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.665
Are you hiding something?

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:41.919
You can tell me. What are you hiding?

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:44.422
I-shin, what are you hiding from me?

00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:47.758
She moved out as soon as she came of age.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:52.054
I barely managed to find her
after asking all over.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:55.725
I-shin, why must you keep
hiding things from me?

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:58.227
I found out that her husband

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.813
was well known for being the town's scum.

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.523
What are you hiding from me?

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.401
I could clearly tell
what sort of life she was living,

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.820
but I couldn't do anything for her.

00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:09.572
Out of concern,

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:12.992
I visited her secretly a few times
just to see

00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:14.994
how she was doing.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.622
I was there that night as well.

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:19.874
Stop it!

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.038
How could you?

00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:02.291
You should've made her turn herself in
or at least reported it to the police.

00:09:04.293 --> 00:09:06.045
If you had reported her then,

00:09:06.128 --> 00:09:08.464
we could've stopped it there,
at the very least.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:11.175
She killed five more people after that.

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:12.969
That woman murdered them.

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:17.098
Why did you just stand by and watch?

00:09:17.181 --> 00:09:18.724
I was going to!

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.686
But I just couldn't bring myself to.

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:24.313
I couldn't do that to my own daughter.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.816
I'm her father!
I can't ruin my kid's life like that.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.194
Yes, I know.

00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:32.613
I am selfish.

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:35.783
I committed an unforgivable sin.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.203
With repentance in mind, I raised you,

00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:42.999
and even took other kids in.

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:45.918
But that doesn't undo what I did.

00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:49.714
I will never stop paying for my sins.

00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:55.344
Anyhow, the active killer
is someone who knows about this.

00:09:56.512 --> 00:09:58.389
Have you told anyone about this?

00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:01.100
Who would I share this with?

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:03.811
No one knows.

00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:06.522
Anyhow, Su-yeol,

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:08.858
you need to end it here.

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:11.277
She is as good as dead.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.279
I even made a gravesite for her.

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:15.323
Up until now,

00:10:15.906 --> 00:10:19.535
we've carried on
as if she were actually dead.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.663
The whole world may not know, but you do.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:25.625
You're sitting here today
because we did all that.

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:26.709
I know.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:28.836
But this is my job.

00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:31.297
If you continue seeing your mother,

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.967
do you think it'll just end
when the job is done?

00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:38.054
That's not how the world works.

00:10:38.929 --> 00:10:39.930
Must you

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:42.183
be the one to catch that killer?

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:44.143
My own mother

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:48.856
claims I am the reason
behind her first murder.

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:51.776
I need to catch him.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:56.405
That woman killed six people.

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:59.950
And now, there's a bastard
who is following in her footsteps.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.661
At this moment,

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.288
we have ten dead people.

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:07.875
I am to blame for the start
of those ten murders.

00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:11.087
I need to catch the killer.

00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:17.009
After that…

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:21.347
I'll be able to live my life.

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:51.043
The culprit knew parts of your past

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:54.255
that even the police didn't know.

00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:57.800
So, we'll start with Yeonpo.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:02.263
These were the neighbors
you had back then.

00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:04.723
By chance, do you remember any of them?

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:16.819
CRIMINAL HISTORY
NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:20.906
I don't see how he could've witnessed
my dad's incident.

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:25.327
It's possible. He was our neighbor.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.084
But he was an alcoholic scumbag too.

00:12:33.794 --> 00:12:35.171
"Assault,

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:36.297
sexual harassment,

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.506
and habitual gambling."

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.008
He was predisposed to crime.

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:43.471
And the chances he's the copycat killer?

00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:48.100
Do you remember anything?

00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:50.978
Jung-yeon.

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:54.190
Is she resilient?

00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:57.735
Would she stay by your side even after

00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:00.154
the world finds out about me?

00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:04.033
I'd leave then.

00:13:07.244 --> 00:13:10.498
Are you just going to let
that district office worker be?

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:13.125
SEO GU-WAN

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:19.798
Then, what should I do?

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.010
Should I kill him?

00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:27.264
Do you think you can do it?

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:32.144
I'll do it.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.271
What?

00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:36.398
When you find yourself

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:39.360
uncomfortable or displeased,

00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:42.530
do you just kill
the person involved first?

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:45.282
I'm not like that.

00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:50.246
And I will protect my family.

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:54.291
Can you drop
this concerned family act already?

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:56.919
Let that be your warning.

00:13:57.836 --> 00:13:59.129
I won't ask nicely next time.

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:08.097
Do you remember anything about him?

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:13.185
His son.

00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:15.771
Do you remember him?

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:22.528
I do.

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:24.655
What about his son?

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.993
His mom left them when he was young.

00:14:29.076 --> 00:14:31.328
He was deeply lonely as a child,

00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:33.455
and also quite emotionally fragile.

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.291
He was always over our house.

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:38.919
I noticed a wound on his body one day.

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:41.589
And every day,
he would show up with a new one.

00:14:43.173 --> 00:14:44.258
Child abuse?

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:48.554
So I went to see that damn father of his…

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:01.317
You scared me…

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:28.844
Min-jae made it seem as if his abuse

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.596
was worse than it actually was.

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:34.934
Why?

00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:37.603
That's what kids do
when they want attention.

00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:43.359
There was only so much I could do
to take care of him on my end.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.361
So?

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:48.781
That's all.

00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:52.534
That's not enough.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.328
He saw me.

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:57.331
I'm sure when he saw me on the news,

00:15:57.414 --> 00:15:59.667
he found out I used anesthesia shots.

00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:04.922
When he realized
I was there to kill his father,

00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:07.758
how do you think he felt?

00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:14.056
He believed Jeong I-shin
was there to save him?

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.182
Yes.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.518
It's quite likely he did.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.651
Park Min-jae has Yeonpo listed
as his current address.

00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:29.363
It looks like he's still living
with Park Eon-bae.

00:16:29.446 --> 00:16:30.572
Yes.

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.616
He's still unable to leave that place,

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.536
despite never having received
any real love there.

00:16:35.619 --> 00:16:37.371
But he had someone

00:16:37.454 --> 00:16:39.873
who was willing
to even murder for his sake.

00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:43.210
For him, Jeong I-shin must have been

00:16:44.044 --> 00:16:45.963
like a mother, maybe more.

00:16:46.046 --> 00:16:50.092
So, you're saying that's why
he's following in her footsteps?

00:16:51.468 --> 00:16:52.469
I'm not sure.

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.179
But I am sure

00:16:55.222 --> 00:16:58.559
that he intentionally lured me
to the well.

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:00.769
As a reminder of my past.

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:03.230
He knows me.

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:09.028
Park Min-jae knows what I look like.

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:12.740
He might already be in my vicinity.

00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:16.910
When I heard your father went missing…

00:17:18.912 --> 00:17:21.582
I did find it a bit strange,
but I wasn't able to question it.

00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:25.419
We had no time with the politicians
breathing down our necks.

00:17:25.502 --> 00:17:28.172
We were relying solely on
what Jeong I-shin was telling us.

00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:31.925
Pursuing a hidden case
was not a luxury we could afford.

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:33.052
This case…

00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:35.095
Let's just keep
your father's case between us.

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.555
If it goes public,

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:39.475
the identity of your mother
will also be exposed.

00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:45.314
I'll look into Park Min-jae.
You, be careful.

00:17:46.106 --> 00:17:47.232
I'll be in touch.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.408
HUBBY SU-YEOL

00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:57.993
Do you feel better now?

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:00.537
Go on. You're standing
in front of your mother-in-law.

00:18:01.371 --> 00:18:03.791
Tell her you're sorry
for suspecting Su-yeol,

00:18:04.541 --> 00:18:05.584
and introduce yourself.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.420
{\an8}JEONG I-SHIN

00:18:13.675 --> 00:18:15.761
I guess someone visits her sometimes.

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:39.618
He said it was the first house you see

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.579
at the end of the forest trail
by the beach.

00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:45.999
This must be it.

00:18:55.175 --> 00:18:57.219
But it looks abandoned.

00:18:57.886 --> 00:18:59.429
Looks like no one lives here.

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:02.182
Hey, don't.

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:05.978
Hey.

00:19:07.354 --> 00:19:10.315
Stop it. You can't just walk in like that.

00:19:26.915 --> 00:19:29.251
This place is a little creepy.

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:31.712
I think we've seen enough.
Let's head back.

00:19:31.795 --> 00:19:33.630
This is someone else's house now.

00:19:34.631 --> 00:19:35.632
Come on.

00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:44.433
I can't do this anymore.

00:19:52.482 --> 00:19:53.483
Jung-yeon!

00:19:54.067 --> 00:19:55.652
- Who are you people?
- Jung-yeon!

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:57.029
Who are you?

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:00.616
Hello, sir.

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:03.744
This used to be
my husband's childhood home.

00:20:03.827 --> 00:20:06.872
We'll just take
a quick look around and leave.

00:20:06.955 --> 00:20:10.042
Sir, why don't you go
and get a drink on us?

00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:12.878
We'll be out of here in no time.

00:20:17.424 --> 00:20:18.592
Dad, what are you doing?

00:20:22.512 --> 00:20:23.764
Give that money back to her.

00:20:25.098 --> 00:20:26.141
Dad.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.602
Give it back to her.

00:20:28.685 --> 00:20:30.270
I don't want to!

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:33.232
Dad.

00:20:34.107 --> 00:20:35.108
Dad!

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:45.202
Sorry about that.
You must have been scared.

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.329
My dad is a bit…

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.623
Hold on.

00:20:53.126 --> 00:20:54.503
I do have one.

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:58.048
- Here.
- No, it's okay. We intruded.

00:20:58.131 --> 00:20:59.591
- We're really sorry.
- It's fine. Take it.

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:02.219
I don't want the countryside
to get a bad rep. Please take it.

00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:06.390
I caught a bit
of your conversation earlier.

00:21:06.473 --> 00:21:08.475
If your husband lived here…

00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:11.436
Are you Jeong I-shin's daughter-in-law?

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.980
Do you know Jeong I-shin?

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.065
I know Auntie I-shin really well.

00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:18.318
She was in her 20s
and a bit young to call an auntie,

00:21:18.402 --> 00:21:20.654
but back then,
that's what we called all married women.

00:21:26.994 --> 00:21:28.036
That's my phone.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.913
It's time for my dad's meds.

00:21:31.164 --> 00:21:33.917
Please excuse me, and enjoy your tour.

00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:36.253
So sorry about earlier.

00:21:41.174 --> 00:21:43.385
Could your eyes be more lovey-dovey?

00:21:43.468 --> 00:21:44.594
Go and chase him down.

00:21:45.512 --> 00:21:48.307
He's so not my type.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.309
I have standards, you know.

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.334
I told you

00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:19.212
to stop embarrassing me
in front of other people!

00:22:19.296 --> 00:22:20.297
Damn it!

00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:48.867
I know.

00:22:54.748 --> 00:22:55.749
Sorry.

00:22:57.959 --> 00:22:59.086
I didn't mean it like that.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.432
{\an8}THERE ARE
NO AVAILABLE CARS NEARBY

00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:15.060
What's the point of buying a car

00:23:15.143 --> 00:23:17.270
when you don't even know how to drive it?

00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:19.439
For decorative purposes. What about it?

00:23:20.982 --> 00:23:24.694
I guess we really are in the countryside.
There's not a single cab around.

00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:27.864
Hello again.

00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:31.993
I actually found this at my place.

00:23:33.161 --> 00:23:35.288
It's a picture
of Auntie and me at the beach.

00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:37.874
Wow, she's so beautiful.

00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:40.210
Have you never seen
a picture of her before?

00:23:40.293 --> 00:23:41.795
No, I haven't.

00:23:41.878 --> 00:23:43.588
I see.

00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:46.800
I feel bad, but that's my only copy.
I can't give it to you.

00:23:48.343 --> 00:23:49.761
Can I take a picture of it?

00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:51.179
Sure.

00:23:54.015 --> 00:23:56.726
If you're on your way back,

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.896
I could give you a ride if you want.
I'm also on my way back.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.189
- We're fine.
- That'd be great.

00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:04.651
All right.
Let me clear your seats for you.

00:24:04.734 --> 00:24:05.735
Just give me a second.

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:12.701
It'll be nice. You can even ask him
about Su-yeol's childhood.

00:24:12.784 --> 00:24:13.952
We should just take a cab.

00:24:14.035 --> 00:24:15.704
We'll be fine.

00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:21.084
Get in.

00:24:24.045 --> 00:24:25.338
FOR LEASE

00:24:25.422 --> 00:24:27.424
Park Min-jae has a business license.

00:24:27.507 --> 00:24:29.176
It's classified as a security business.

00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:31.553
It looks like
it's some sort of detective agency.

00:24:31.636 --> 00:24:32.929
Where is it?

00:24:33.013 --> 00:24:35.807
I'm at the address now,
but it was shut down a long time ago.

00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:36.975
Where are you?

00:24:37.058 --> 00:24:38.059
Home.

00:24:38.727 --> 00:24:40.353
I couldn't reach Jung-yeon.

00:24:40.437 --> 00:24:42.105
This has never happened before.

00:24:42.189 --> 00:24:43.607
I'm worried, so I'm waiting for her.

00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:51.823
- Let me call you back.
- Bro.

00:24:52.782 --> 00:24:54.659
Jeong-ho. It's you, isn't it?

00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:56.203
Wait, Su-yeol now, right?

00:24:57.412 --> 00:25:00.040
What's up? Don't you remember me?

00:25:00.123 --> 00:25:01.458
It's me. Park Min-jae.

00:25:02.292 --> 00:25:04.628
Way to bring someone down.

00:25:04.711 --> 00:25:07.672
Oh, right. We were at Yeonpo.

00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:08.798
What were you doing there?

00:25:09.382 --> 00:25:12.219
Right. I should get going.

00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:13.720
Take care.

00:25:13.803 --> 00:25:15.722
Here. These are dried cod fillets.

00:25:16.556 --> 00:25:18.308
Yeonpo's local specialty.
A souvenir for you.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.061
Goodbye then.

00:25:21.144 --> 00:25:23.188
You don't remember him?
He said he lived next door.

00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:32.948
Min-jae.

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:37.786
Park Min-jae, right?

00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:41.748
So you do remember me.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.084
That's me. Park Min-jae.

00:25:49.464 --> 00:25:52.425
So, are you almost done
with the current webtoon series?

00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:56.221
The killer will be caught
after five people fall victim.

00:25:56.304 --> 00:25:58.640
About three of the victims will be…

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:02.227
Park Min-jae's car is in front
of my place right now.

00:26:02.769 --> 00:26:04.896
It is? How?

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.981
I'll explain later.

00:26:06.064 --> 00:26:10.068
First, get his plate number
and find out its vehicle storage site.

00:26:11.194 --> 00:26:14.197
Min-jae, you can't drink
because you need to drive, right?

00:26:14.281 --> 00:26:15.991
I'll just drink water.

00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:17.867
But still, that's a bit…

00:26:19.202 --> 00:26:20.704
Are you sure about the lip color?

00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:23.540
Isn't it really pretty? It's pretty close.

00:26:23.623 --> 00:26:26.876
- It's a bit of a grapefruit color.
- What? I don't really like grapefruit.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.169
What were you doing in Yeonpo?

00:26:30.547 --> 00:26:32.716
We got out of the city
and stopped by on the way back.

00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:34.843
Why didn't you answer your phone?

00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:43.393
What's going on? Can I join?

00:26:44.811 --> 00:26:45.895
Of course.

00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:48.523
You totally can, but by any chance,
do you have any ketchup?

00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:51.276
Dried cod fillet tastes best with ketchup.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.154
Jung-yeon, look at that.
He says that's me.

00:26:55.322 --> 00:26:58.950
Oh, but you know, there is…

00:26:59.034 --> 00:27:00.702
There is a sort of resemblance.

00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:02.329
- Right?
- Really?

00:27:02.412 --> 00:27:04.789
I mean, he is a webtoon artist, after all.

00:27:04.873 --> 00:27:06.750
Can you also sign it for me at the bottom?

00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:08.418
I'll cash it in if you ever get famous.

00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:12.339
What a nice way of saying I'm not.

00:27:17.385 --> 00:27:19.304
Wait. Hold that. That's the perfect angle.

00:27:19.387 --> 00:27:21.639
Just hold that pose. Let me draw you.

00:27:24.225 --> 00:27:26.186
That's perfect.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.661
SEARCH

00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:48.625
SEOYEON-DONG,
NAMGWANG-GU, GWANGJU

00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:54.881
Do you really not remember?

00:27:54.964 --> 00:27:56.341
When we were little,

00:27:57.008 --> 00:28:00.595
we used to teach city folk
how to separate crab meat and stuff.

00:28:01.388 --> 00:28:03.681
Yeah, I don't know
why I don't remember that at all.

00:28:04.641 --> 00:28:06.309
What's wrong with you?

00:28:08.645 --> 00:28:09.854
Hold on.

00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:12.273
Then…

00:28:13.608 --> 00:28:15.527
do you not remember
the Mantis Case, either?

00:28:16.986 --> 00:28:18.113
"The Mantis"?

00:28:18.905 --> 00:28:21.032
But doesn't everyone know about that?

00:28:22.617 --> 00:28:23.827
I don't know.

00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:27.622
Maybe not.

00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:28.998
The World Cup was on then.

00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:32.293
What is it?

00:28:36.798 --> 00:28:39.592
A serial killer.

00:28:41.261 --> 00:28:43.388
It was seriously such a mess back then.

00:28:44.097 --> 00:28:49.227
If you cross a bridge from Yeonpo,
there's this mining town.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.437
It's in Woongsan.

00:28:50.979 --> 00:28:52.689
And some young woman there

00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:55.024
killed five people.

00:28:56.109 --> 00:28:57.986
Five? Why?

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:01.239
But he'd know
more about that than I would.

00:29:01.322 --> 00:29:02.574
He's the police officer here.

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:06.953
No, I actually don't know
much about that, either.

00:29:07.787 --> 00:29:08.997
It's an old case.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.708
Then, I can tell you about it.

00:29:13.168 --> 00:29:14.669
They said she was in her 20s.

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:17.255
They never revealed her face
or name for some reason.

00:29:17.338 --> 00:29:19.716
She became famous
for her nickname, the Mantis.

00:29:20.508 --> 00:29:22.343
She brutally killed only men

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:24.220
who abused women and children.

00:29:25.346 --> 00:29:28.725
To be fair, her victims committed
far more heinous acts.

00:29:28.808 --> 00:29:30.477
No matter how heinous…

00:29:35.899 --> 00:29:38.193
it doesn't mean
you can just kill people like that.

00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:41.654
We have laws for a reason.

00:29:41.738 --> 00:29:44.282
Right.
You are a police officer, after all.

00:29:44.866 --> 00:29:48.703
But when you look at it
from an artist's perspective,

00:29:48.787 --> 00:29:50.288
I honestly just think

00:29:50.371 --> 00:29:52.749
the Mantis had great empathy.

00:29:52.832 --> 00:29:55.418
She was really sensitive
to other people's suffering.

00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:57.670
So, the men,
who abused those women and kids,

00:29:57.754 --> 00:29:59.714
were made to feel the same pain and--

00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:00.799
Get a hold of yourself.

00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:06.930
It was murder. Nothing more.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.057
She killed another person.

00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:12.101
I know that. I do.

00:30:12.185 --> 00:30:15.188
But I can kind of see his point.

00:30:15.271 --> 00:30:18.399
I think if I were the victim's family,
it would've felt cathartic.

00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:22.028
They were freed from their abusers.

00:30:22.111 --> 00:30:23.488
But if I'm being honest,

00:30:24.697 --> 00:30:26.032
I've always been more curious

00:30:26.866 --> 00:30:28.493
about her son than about her.

00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:31.287
She had a son?

00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:34.082
Yes, it was reported on the news.

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:36.125
I see.

00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:39.504
Wow. To have a serial killer as a mom…

00:30:40.213 --> 00:30:41.881
I wonder what that feels like.

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:43.967
He should be around our age now.

00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:47.011
Right?

00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:50.014
But why do you address him
as if he were older?

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.100
Aren't you two the same age?

00:30:53.726 --> 00:30:55.103
There's a story behind that too.

00:30:55.728 --> 00:30:59.065
When we were little,
I ended up breaking the side-view mirror

00:30:59.148 --> 00:31:00.859
of some visitor's car while playing ball.

00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:02.944
Hey, where the hell is it?

00:31:03.778 --> 00:31:05.113
Where's your damn house?

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:06.739
I'm sorry. Just let me go this once.

00:31:06.823 --> 00:31:08.741
Why this punk…

00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:11.202
Where's your house?
You said you lived nearby.

00:31:14.914 --> 00:31:15.957
Why this punk…

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.919
Hey, is that your boy?

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.131
Yes. He's my boy.

00:31:23.756 --> 00:31:24.757
Why do you ask?

00:31:25.258 --> 00:31:28.094
She had such a warm embrace.

00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:33.141
Auntie paid for the side-view mirror.

00:31:33.683 --> 00:31:34.934
After that day,

00:31:35.018 --> 00:31:37.061
I was over there almost every day.

00:31:37.145 --> 00:31:38.897
Your mother sounds nice.

00:31:40.857 --> 00:31:42.984
So, why would that make him older?

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:44.068
Oh, right.

00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:48.823
I guess that man really had his doubts
about me being her son.

00:31:49.365 --> 00:31:50.533
So, he turned to Su-yeol,

00:31:50.617 --> 00:31:53.286
and asked if I was
really his older brother.

00:31:53.828 --> 00:31:56.122
Then, Su-yeol said,
"No, he's my younger brother."

00:31:56.205 --> 00:31:57.916
That's exactly what he said.

00:31:59.208 --> 00:32:01.169
But I was taller than him back then.

00:32:01.252 --> 00:32:02.629
I'm fine with it.

00:32:02.712 --> 00:32:04.881
I've addressed him as my older bro
ever since that day.

00:32:04.964 --> 00:32:07.091
My dad didn't like it,

00:32:07.175 --> 00:32:09.427
but I practically lived at that house.

00:32:10.637 --> 00:32:14.098
Auntie really treated me like a son.

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:16.893
But that accident

00:32:17.727 --> 00:32:19.312
just took her without warning.

00:32:23.524 --> 00:32:24.984
Jeez. What's wrong with me?

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:37.205
Tonight was fun.

00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:38.831
Come see us again.

00:32:38.915 --> 00:32:39.916
Okay.

00:32:41.501 --> 00:32:42.627
See you.

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:44.003
- Bye.
- Bye, Ah-ra.

00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:45.129
Get home safely.

00:32:58.601 --> 00:33:01.020
But why did you really go to Yeonpo?

00:33:01.604 --> 00:33:03.022
I wanted to confirm

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.025
that your mother really did pass away.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:15.451
You must've overheard

00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:18.079
Mr. Jeong and me talking outside.

00:33:19.706 --> 00:33:22.417
Your phone rang and I picked it up.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.961
Mr. Jeong suddenly said
you shouldn't see your mom.

00:33:25.044 --> 00:33:27.422
He sounded really worried.

00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:29.465
So?

00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:32.927
Was there a grave at Yeonpo?

00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:37.140
It's been cleared up now?

00:33:38.725 --> 00:33:40.560
That settles it. Let's go back inside.

00:33:42.812 --> 00:33:44.105
You don't want one, right?

00:33:44.814 --> 00:33:45.815
What?

00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:49.068
You don't want a baby.

00:33:49.986 --> 00:33:51.029
What?

00:33:52.613 --> 00:33:54.032
Where did that come from?

00:33:54.115 --> 00:33:55.742
Don't play dumb.

00:33:56.325 --> 00:33:57.827
I feel like it's all connected.

00:33:58.411 --> 00:34:01.372
That issue and the family
you try to keep secret.

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:03.708
Jung-yeon.

00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:07.587
You had a lot to drink.
We can talk about this later.

00:34:12.383 --> 00:34:13.801
You're done talking, right?

00:34:17.263 --> 00:34:19.807
Jung-yeon, what has gotten into you?

00:34:31.652 --> 00:34:33.321
CHIEF CHOI JUNG-HO

00:34:38.618 --> 00:34:41.829
SEOYEON-DONG,
NAMGWANG-GU, GWANGJU

00:35:16.864 --> 00:35:19.617
Your phone rang and I picked it up.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.328
Mr. Jeong suddenly said
you shouldn't see your mom.

00:35:47.979 --> 00:35:49.647
Park Min-jae, that bastard.

00:36:01.075 --> 00:36:02.743
I'm heading to the vehicle storage site.

00:36:18.384 --> 00:36:22.597
SEONGSIN PNP PRINTING
CUTTING, BINDING

00:36:38.321 --> 00:36:39.488
What are you doing?

00:36:42.825 --> 00:36:43.868
I guess you could call it

00:36:45.786 --> 00:36:46.787
timid flirtation?

00:37:00.343 --> 00:37:01.385
Min-jae.

00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:04.722
Let's take the time to get
to know one another.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.808
I'll call you.

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:08.893
Okay.

00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:02.113
{\an8}SPEEDY DETECTIVE AGENCY
PARK MIN-JAE

00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:16.919
JEONG I-SHIN

00:38:30.725 --> 00:38:32.101
Where are you?

00:38:32.184 --> 00:38:33.519
The vehicle storage site.

00:38:33.602 --> 00:38:36.480
It looks like Park Min-jae lives here.

00:38:36.564 --> 00:38:38.774
What? You don't even have a warrant.

00:38:38.858 --> 00:38:42.069
Hey, get out of there now. I'm on my way.

00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:44.572
Didn't I tell you
I felt him in my vicinity?

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:45.656
I was right.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.408
This bastard

00:38:47.491 --> 00:38:49.535
had been spying
on Jung-yeon and me this whole time.

00:38:49.618 --> 00:38:52.121
What if he catches on that we know,
and goes into hiding?

00:38:54.248 --> 00:38:55.708
What the…? Hey.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.002
Damn it.

00:39:01.047 --> 00:39:03.799
Hello? Sir? Are you all right?

00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:04.884
Sir!

00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:06.135
I lost him.

00:39:07.386 --> 00:39:09.388
Su-yeol, you need to get out of there now.

00:39:09.472 --> 00:39:10.514
Okay.

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:56.102
SEONGSIN PNP PRINTING

00:40:50.364 --> 00:40:51.699
What the hell?

00:40:57.955 --> 00:40:58.956
You're dead.

00:41:04.753 --> 00:41:05.754
It was you.

00:41:05.838 --> 00:41:06.881
You killed them.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:08.883
You killed them all, didn't you?

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:10.634
What? Who?

00:41:20.603 --> 00:41:21.729
You met her.

00:41:22.771 --> 00:41:23.772
Didn't you?

00:41:24.356 --> 00:41:25.983
To discuss the murder case.

00:41:26.066 --> 00:41:27.359
Shut up!

00:41:29.445 --> 00:41:30.738
Please tell me.

00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:34.074
Is our mom

00:41:35.576 --> 00:41:36.827
doing well?

00:41:43.083 --> 00:41:44.168
Hello, ma'am.

00:41:44.251 --> 00:41:45.252
Hello.

00:41:45.753 --> 00:41:47.630
I'll let Chief Choi know.

00:41:47.713 --> 00:41:48.714
All right.

00:41:59.016 --> 00:42:00.893
RESTRICTED AREA

00:42:06.899 --> 00:42:08.651
I'm sorry.

00:42:09.276 --> 00:42:10.653
Please forgive me.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.051
Jeong I-shin!

00:42:35.678 --> 00:42:36.845
Jeong I-shin.

00:42:37.346 --> 00:42:39.014
Jeong I-shin.

00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:41.517
Jeong I-shin.

00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:47.773
Mr. Seo, can you hear me? Mr. Seo.

00:43:11.797 --> 00:43:13.132
What do you think you're doing?

00:43:13.215 --> 00:43:14.883
What did you just feed me?

00:43:55.674 --> 00:43:58.177
You say I killed someone.

00:43:59.511 --> 00:44:00.638
With this thing?

00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:10.272
What a world it'd be if all it took
was this to overpower someone.

00:44:10.856 --> 00:44:12.733
You live in the light and know

00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:14.485
so little about what happens in the dark.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.321
When cheaters are caught,

00:44:17.404 --> 00:44:20.157
do you think they get embarrassed
and hide under the covers?

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.325
They do not.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:25.913
They glare right back and charge at you
without any clothes on.

00:44:27.873 --> 00:44:29.124
You think this would be enough?

00:44:34.463 --> 00:44:35.631
Yeah, sure.

00:44:35.714 --> 00:44:37.841
December 7th.

00:44:38.384 --> 00:44:41.136
Tell me what you were doing
from 9:00 p.m. to midnight.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.097
I don't know.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.348
I'm sure I did something.

00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:47.059
Do you remember exactly
what you did last week?

00:44:47.142 --> 00:44:48.143
Park Min-jae.

00:44:48.227 --> 00:44:50.020
You are a suspect in this case.

00:44:50.104 --> 00:44:51.647
Think it through before you answer.

00:44:55.234 --> 00:44:57.069
You're seriously so cool.

00:44:58.153 --> 00:45:00.197
So this is you at work, huh?

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.741
- If only Mom got to see this--
- December!

00:45:06.495 --> 00:45:08.122
I asked you about December 7th.

00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:12.876
It seems like Mom is
a major trigger for you.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.795
Your veins pop as soon as she's mentioned.

00:45:21.468 --> 00:45:22.678
All right. Fine.

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.472
Let me see a laptop.

00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:26.765
One with Internet.

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:30.018
Why?

00:45:30.102 --> 00:45:32.312
Even in this industry,
competition is fierce these days.

00:45:32.896 --> 00:45:34.857
Expense reports are just the start.

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:37.860
I need to give the client an hourly report
of what I've been up to.

00:45:37.943 --> 00:45:40.320
I make it a point to share
my live location feed with them.

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:42.823
You can see exactly
what I was doing and where I was

00:45:43.323 --> 00:45:44.324
during those hours.

00:45:47.828 --> 00:45:48.871
Mr. Seo.

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:53.500
Mr. Seo, look at me.

00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:54.835
Are you okay?

00:45:55.794 --> 00:45:56.795
Can you see me?

00:45:56.879 --> 00:45:58.547
Where…

00:46:01.675 --> 00:46:02.843
Look at me.

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:04.678
We met at the police station.

00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:09.975
This is so suffocating.

00:46:10.058 --> 00:46:12.478
I can't breathe.

00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:15.314
My hand hurts so much.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.567
Can't you please help me? Just this once?

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:20.235
Please save me.

00:46:20.986 --> 00:46:22.488
Please.

00:46:22.571 --> 00:46:24.907
Please save me.

00:46:33.165 --> 00:46:34.583
Is that better?

00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:36.376
Thank you.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:43.008
She's going to kill.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:44.801
Who?

00:46:45.594 --> 00:46:46.595
Me.

00:46:47.429 --> 00:46:48.764
Who would do that?

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:50.641
The Mantis.

00:46:50.724 --> 00:46:53.143
Jeong I-shin is in prison right now.

00:46:54.436 --> 00:46:56.021
I heard the recent murders

00:46:56.104 --> 00:46:58.649
resemble the Mantis murders a bit.

00:46:58.732 --> 00:47:00.067
Hurry up.

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.860
Forget MO.

00:47:01.944 --> 00:47:05.113
Did people who deserved to die get killed?
That's what counts.

00:47:05.197 --> 00:47:06.949
Is that what's happening?

00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:16.625
It looks like the chief is here alone.

00:47:16.708 --> 00:47:19.586
I guess you're trying to keep me
a secret from the other cops.

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.004
They must not know.

00:47:22.422 --> 00:47:24.174
About you and Mom…

00:47:24.258 --> 00:47:25.425
You really need to shut up.

00:47:27.094 --> 00:47:28.220
You're very distracting.

00:47:28.303 --> 00:47:30.764
I'm not trying
to make your life difficult.

00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:34.810
The fake grave you set up
to keep that secret…

00:47:36.186 --> 00:47:37.563
I'll be taking that to my grave.

00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:40.941
Speaking of…

00:47:44.236 --> 00:47:46.446
can you let me see Mom, just once?

00:47:48.824 --> 00:47:50.284
You are going nowhere

00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:54.663
until we confirm it was you
on this route and not just your phone.

00:47:55.414 --> 00:47:56.415
Got that?

00:48:01.003 --> 00:48:02.254
Can I get some water?

00:48:02.796 --> 00:48:04.339
It's time for my meds.

00:48:07.759 --> 00:48:09.720
You don't know shit.

00:48:09.803 --> 00:48:11.471
You're right. I don't.

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:13.015
That's why I'm here.

00:48:13.098 --> 00:48:15.517
Why is Jeong I-shin trying to kill you?

00:48:15.601 --> 00:48:17.185
Because I know.

00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:18.979
Everything.

00:48:19.813 --> 00:48:21.064
I am a police officer.

00:48:21.148 --> 00:48:22.649
I can protect you.

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:23.859
Jeong I-shin's Murder Zero.

00:48:23.942 --> 00:48:26.069
You're the only one
who knew about it, right?

00:48:27.821 --> 00:48:30.532
You can tell me. I'll keep you safe.

00:48:37.039 --> 00:48:39.666
You couldn't even protect
your own damn son.

00:48:48.675 --> 00:48:51.261
You're asking about
the young man who likes ketchup?

00:48:51.803 --> 00:48:53.388
Of course, I know him. He's a regular.

00:48:53.972 --> 00:48:57.643
By chance, was he here
on the night of December 7th, as well?

00:48:57.726 --> 00:48:59.353
Hold on.

00:48:59.978 --> 00:49:02.689
I remember him saying he was really busy.

00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:05.609
He almost came in
every night for pork cutlets.

00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:16.119
Seo Gu-wan.

00:49:16.203 --> 00:49:17.371
Seo Gu-wan!

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:43.438
Yes, Detective Kim.

00:49:43.522 --> 00:49:45.023
Seo Gu-wan did what?

00:49:45.107 --> 00:49:46.108
I'm with the police.

00:49:46.608 --> 00:49:49.027
Ma'am. He made it out of the hospital.

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:51.071
Damn it!

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:31.820
Detective Kim!

00:50:34.656 --> 00:50:35.657
Sir.

00:50:35.741 --> 00:50:38.827
I'll look from here to there.

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:40.704
Can you look back there?

00:50:40.787 --> 00:50:43.081
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

00:50:44.583 --> 00:50:45.876
Sorry.

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:55.218
Seo Gu-wan!

00:50:56.344 --> 00:50:57.471
Hey, Seo Gu-wan!

00:51:16.656 --> 00:51:17.657
Seo Gu-wan!

00:51:19.201 --> 00:51:20.869
Seo Gu-wan!

00:51:23.163 --> 00:51:24.498
That's enough!

00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:25.999
Stop it already!

00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:27.167
Seo Gu-wan!

00:51:27.834 --> 00:51:28.835
Seo Gu-wan!

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:34.591
Why can't I have that?

00:51:36.301 --> 00:51:38.553
Why does everyone abandon me?

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.224
Why is it just always me?

00:51:49.356 --> 00:51:50.565
Seo Gu-wan!

00:51:51.525 --> 00:51:54.653
You bastard, stop following me already!

00:51:54.736 --> 00:51:55.737
Seo Gu-wan!

00:52:06.248 --> 00:52:07.249
Seo Gu-wan!

00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:18.343
- Seo Gu-wan!
- What was that?

00:52:25.016 --> 00:52:26.476
There's been a car accident.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.895
Near Gwanghyeon Intersection.
In front of Bogwang Bank.

00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:30.313
It's an emergency.

00:52:32.858 --> 00:52:34.025
Seo Gu-wan.

00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:36.361
The ambulance is coming.
Save your energy. Stay still.

00:52:36.444 --> 00:52:37.487
Why?

00:52:38.071 --> 00:52:41.950
Isn't this what you wanted?

00:52:42.033 --> 00:52:44.536
Because I know about

00:52:46.037 --> 00:52:48.164
you, the Mantis,

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:51.042
and your damn wife.

00:52:51.126 --> 00:52:54.296
I'm going to tell
the whole world about them.

00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:58.633
What did you say?

00:52:58.717 --> 00:52:59.885
You…

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.638
want me dead too, don't you?

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:06.975
No.

00:53:07.058 --> 00:53:08.810
When you shot yourself,

00:53:09.519 --> 00:53:11.354
I saved you.

00:53:11.897 --> 00:53:16.401
Back then, there were other cops around.

00:53:18.612 --> 00:53:20.405
Same bloodline.

00:53:21.948 --> 00:53:23.199
You…

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:26.995
are just like your mother.

00:53:30.498 --> 00:53:32.375
I'm jealous of you.

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:46.139
Damn it.

00:54:03.657 --> 00:54:05.992
It seems she had been
secretly raising oil beetles

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:09.162
in the bathroom vent
where there were no CCTV cameras around.

00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:13.124
And she fed me the poison
she collected from them.

00:54:16.336 --> 00:54:17.420
It was my mistake.

00:54:24.219 --> 00:54:25.679
Damn it.

00:54:29.182 --> 00:54:30.266
My apologies.

00:54:32.644 --> 00:54:33.728
She took your shoes too?

00:54:56.167 --> 00:54:57.210
Why'd you do it?

00:54:59.546 --> 00:55:01.006
I was hoping to gather

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:04.134
more intel for the case.

00:55:04.884 --> 00:55:07.971
Didn't I tell you he was being held
at the hospital for mental instability?

00:55:09.889 --> 00:55:11.683
What in the world did you tell him?

00:55:13.059 --> 00:55:15.437
Something must have set him off.

00:55:17.772 --> 00:55:18.857
My apologies, sir.

00:55:19.524 --> 00:55:21.317
Why did you free him

00:55:23.236 --> 00:55:24.529
from his restraints?

00:55:26.031 --> 00:55:28.116
If he hadn't been worked
into such a frenzy,

00:55:28.199 --> 00:55:29.993
he would still be alive.

00:55:30.785 --> 00:55:31.828
I'm sorry, sir.

00:55:35.081 --> 00:55:37.167
But the hit-and-run driver who killed him…

00:55:38.543 --> 00:55:40.545
What if it wasn't accidental,
but intentional?

00:55:40.628 --> 00:55:42.839
As soon as Seo popped out of the alleyway,

00:55:42.922 --> 00:55:45.925
the driver hit him as if he were
their target before fleeing.

00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:47.302
Who could it be?

00:55:47.385 --> 00:55:50.263
What if this was the serial killer's way

00:55:50.346 --> 00:55:52.140
of silencing Seo Gu-wan?

00:55:53.266 --> 00:55:54.684
You remember Murder Zero, right?

00:55:57.228 --> 00:55:58.229
He must've known

00:55:59.147 --> 00:56:02.192
something about the Jeong Won-sik case.
That's why--

00:56:02.275 --> 00:56:03.276
That's enough.

00:56:04.402 --> 00:56:07.405
I am the squad leader.
You should've looped me in beforehand.

00:56:08.615 --> 00:56:09.783
Detective Kim.

00:56:11.159 --> 00:56:12.827
Do you have an issue with me?

00:56:12.911 --> 00:56:15.789
Was it bad enough for you
to completely ignore all protocol?

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:17.999
Did you have no faith in me at all?

00:56:18.583 --> 00:56:20.668
You should just speak your mind here.

00:56:22.337 --> 00:56:23.713
I do not harbor such feelings.

00:56:24.297 --> 00:56:27.926
You resent the fact
that I'm your squad leader, don't you?

00:56:28.843 --> 00:56:30.303
If it weren't for me,

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:33.932
you'd be the squad leader. Is that why?

00:56:38.019 --> 00:56:40.188
I heard you got into trouble a lot,
back at Narcotics.

00:56:41.815 --> 00:56:45.235
Do you think your position will be safe
if you stir up more trouble here?

00:56:45.318 --> 00:56:48.196
Say, if the entire team defies you.

00:56:52.367 --> 00:56:54.160
Are you threatening me right now?

00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:57.288
We did not follow your orders
because you were the squad leader.

00:56:57.372 --> 00:56:59.415
We did it thinking it'd help the case.

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:01.292
If we had thought otherwise--

00:57:01.376 --> 00:57:03.545
And does this help solve the case?

00:57:04.629 --> 00:57:06.172
Another person died!

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:09.467
Do you want to do this while his blood
is still fresh on our hands?

00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:11.970
We're nowhere close
to identifying the culprit.

00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:14.097
And what happens

00:57:14.722 --> 00:57:17.851
if someone else dies before we do?
What then?

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:20.437
You're not the only one suffering.
This is hard on all of us.

00:57:21.563 --> 00:57:22.605
Us.

00:57:24.482 --> 00:57:25.942
Please excuse me.

00:57:27.152 --> 00:57:28.945
I need to catch the hit-and-run driver.

00:57:43.418 --> 00:57:45.170
MISTER JUNG-HO

00:57:47.213 --> 00:57:48.256
Hello?

00:57:53.845 --> 00:57:55.013
Have you gone insane?

00:57:55.847 --> 00:57:57.849
So what the hell
have you been doing for four hours?

00:57:59.225 --> 00:58:00.226
Damn it.

00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:42.227
Who is it?

00:58:48.566 --> 00:58:49.567
Ms. Lee Jung-yeon?

00:58:56.074 --> 00:58:57.075
Hello.

00:59:30.942 --> 00:59:32.694
{\an8}The forgotten serial killer
everyone thought was dead

00:59:32.777 --> 00:59:34.737
{\an8}is perfectly alive
and running around out there.

00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:37.782
{\an8}- Did you kill Seo Gu-wan?
- You tell me first.

00:59:37.865 --> 00:59:40.743
{\an8}Are you not the slightest bit relieved
to hear he is dead?

00:59:40.827 --> 00:59:42.412
{\an8}Park Min-jae was freed already.

00:59:42.495 --> 00:59:44.038
{\an8}Get your shit together.

00:59:44.122 --> 00:59:46.583
{\an8}Stop idolizing
that despicable serial killer,

00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:48.418
{\an8}and try to live a normal life.

00:59:48.501 --> 00:59:50.837
{\an8}It's a dating app. A woman named Jo-i.

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.047
{\an8}All four victims followed her profile.

00:59:53.673 --> 00:59:55.341
{\an8}Deliver the phone to that woman.

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:57.427
{\an8}"That woman"? What is he talking about?

00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:02.515
