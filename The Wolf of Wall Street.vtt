<i>The world of investing</i>

00:48.090 --> 00:49.817

00:50.217 --> 00:52.160
<i>Bulls. Bears.</i>

00:52.678 --> 00:54.200
<i>Danger at every turn.</i>

00:54.555 --> 00:57.306
<i>That's why we at Stratton Oakmont</i>

One!

Two!

01:18.120 --> 01:19.312
Three!

01:24.751 --> 01:28.230
Twenty-five grand to the first
cocksucker to nail a bull's-eye!

01:29.673 --> 01:31.070
Come on! Let's go!

01:32.551 --> 01:33.823
One!

01:34.344 --> 01:35.445
Two!

01:36.221 --> 01:37.447
Three!

<i>My name is Jordan Belfort.</i>

01:40.183 --> 01:41.375
<i>Not him.</i>

01:41.518 --> 01:43.269
<i>Me. That's right.</i>

01:43.270 --> 01:45.187
<i>I'm a former member
of the middle class</i>

01:45.188 --> 01:49.134
<i>raised by two accountants in a
tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.</i>

01:49.526 --> 01:50.860
<i>The year I turned 26,</i>

01:50.861 --> 01:52.903
<i>as the head of my
own brokerage firm,</i>

01:52.904 --> 01:55.656
<i>I made $49 million,</i>

01:55.657 --> 01:59.182
<i>which really pissed me off because it
was three shy of a million a week.</i>

02:03.373 --> 02:05.416
<i>No, no, no. My Ferrari was white,</i>

02:05.417 --> 02:08.145
<i>like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.
Not red.</i>

02:12.966 --> 02:15.217
<i>See that humongous
estate down there?</i>

02:15.218 --> 02:16.661
<i>That's my house.</i>

02:16.762 --> 02:18.304
<i>For millionaires whose ships...</i>

02:18.305 --> 02:20.264
<i>My wife, Naomi,</i>

02:20.265 --> 02:22.642
<i>the Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,</i>

02:22.643 --> 02:24.837
<i>a former model and
Miller Lite girl.</i>

02:25.729 --> 02:26.937
Yeah.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.565
<i>She was the one with my cock
in her mouth in the Ferrari.</i>

02:29.566 --> 02:31.668
<i>So put your dick
back in your pants.</i>

02:32.277 --> 02:35.029
<i>In addition to Naomi
and my two perfect kids,</i>

02:35.030 --> 02:36.781
<i>I own a mansion, private jet,</i>

02:36.782 --> 02:38.616
<i>six cars, three horses,</i>

02:38.617 --> 02:39.950
<i>two vacation homes,</i>

02:39.951 --> 02:42.179

02:43.288 --> 02:45.186
<i>Anchors aweigh!</i>

02:48.752 --> 02:50.711
<i>I also gamble like a degenerate.</i>

02:50.712 --> 02:51.879
<i>I drink like a fish.</i>

02:51.880 --> 02:54.924
<i>I fuck hookers maybe five,
six times a week.</i>

02:54.925 --> 02:57.869
<i>I have three different federal
agencies looking to indict me.</i>

02:57.928 --> 03:00.596
<i>Oh, yeah, and I love drugs.</i>

03:06.019 --> 03:07.120
Okay.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.313
- One more round.
- Oh, yeah.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.916
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.934
Pull up. Pull up!
We're gonna crash, for Christ sake!

03:25.122 --> 03:26.394
Relax!

03:27.958 --> 03:29.355
Just relax.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.364
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.081
Good job.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.748
You get in there safe, all right?

03:46.852 --> 03:48.704
Till the next time, brother.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.251
Till next time.

03:55.944 --> 03:59.155
Yup, on a daily basis
I consume enough drugs

03:59.156 --> 04:04.729
to sedate Manhattan,
Long Island and Queens for a month.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.604
Okay, Mr. Jordan.

04:06.788 --> 04:10.499
I take Quaaludes 10 to 15 times
a day for my "back pain,"

04:10.500 --> 04:12.398
Adderall to stay focused,

04:12.836 --> 04:15.379
Xanax to take the edge off,
pot to mellow me out,

04:15.380 --> 04:18.450
cocaine to wake me back up again
and morphine, well,

04:18.716 --> 04:19.988
because it's awesome.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.111
Good morning, Nathan.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.454
But of all the drugs
under God's blue heaven,

04:30.479 --> 04:32.798
there is one that is
my absolute favorite.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.091
You see,

04:35.692 --> 04:38.295
enough of this shit'll
make you invincible.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.405
Able to conquer the world,

04:41.406 --> 04:43.133
and eviscerate your enemies.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.302
Ah!

04:46.369 --> 04:48.563
And I'm not talking about this.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.732
I'm talking about this.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.670
<i>See, money doesn't just
buy you a better life,</i>

04:56.671 --> 04:59.215
<i>better food, better
cars, better pussy.</i>

04:59.216 --> 05:01.592
<i>It also makes you a better person.</i>

05:01.593 --> 05:03.385
<i>You can give generously
to the church</i>

05:03.386 --> 05:05.304
<i>or political party of your choice.</i>

05:05.305 --> 05:07.954
<i>You can save the fucking
spotted owl with money.</i>

05:12.646 --> 05:15.499
<i>I always wanted to be rich.
So let me go back.</i>

05:15.774 --> 05:17.983
<i>I'm 22 years old, newly married,</i>

05:17.984 --> 05:20.507
<i>and already a
money-crazed little shit.</i>

05:20.529 --> 05:21.779
<i>So what do I do?</i>

05:21.780 --> 05:23.280
<i>I go to the one place on Earth</i>

05:23.281 --> 05:25.679
<i>that befit my
high-minded ambitions.</i>

05:27.869 --> 05:28.970
I love you.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.484
<i>You are lower than pond scum.</i>

05:43.718 --> 05:45.491
You got a problem with that,

05:46.054 --> 05:47.280
Jordan?

05:47.889 --> 05:49.582
No. No problem at all.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.183
Good. Because that is what you are.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.501
Pond scum.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.144
Your job is connector,

05:54.145 --> 05:58.023
which means that you'll be dialing
the phone over 500 times a day

05:58.024 --> 06:00.985
trying to connect me
with wealthy business owners.

06:00.986 --> 06:03.028
And until you pass your Series 7,

06:03.029 --> 06:05.322
that is all you're gonna
fucking be doing. Sit.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.549
Sit!

06:07.617 --> 06:11.120
Now just so you know,
last year I made over $300,000.

06:11.121 --> 06:14.475
The other guy you'll be working
for, he made over a million.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.458
<i>A million dollars?</i>

06:16.459 --> 06:19.062
<i>I could only imagine
what a douchebag that guy must be.</i>

06:19.629 --> 06:22.278
- Jordan Belfort.
- Yes, sir.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.238
- Mark Hanna.
- A pleasure to meet you.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.862
And you as well. I see you've
already met the village asshole.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.637
Smile and dial.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.116
And don't pick up your
fucking head until 1:00.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.725
Hey, fuck him.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.454
I'm the senior broker here.
He's just a worthless piker.

06:35.604 --> 06:36.921
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

06:37.480 --> 06:40.629
Now did you really pitch a stock
in your job interview?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.586
I had to do something to stand out.
Right, sir?

06:43.612 --> 06:45.089
I fucking love that.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.640
- Lunch. Today.
- Yeah.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.618
We don't start dialing at 9:30

06:50.619 --> 06:53.537
because our clients are
already answering the phone.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.165
Three. Two. One.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.267
Let's fuck!

06:59.044 --> 07:01.003
<i>You want to know
what money sounds like?</i>

07:01.004 --> 07:03.047
<i>Go to a trading floor
on Wall Street.</i>

07:03.048 --> 07:04.590
<i>"Fuck" this, "shit" that.</i>

07:04.591 --> 07:06.091
<i>"Cunt, " "cock," "asshole. "</i>

07:06.092 --> 07:08.385
<i>I couldn't believe how these
guys talked to each other.</i>

07:08.386 --> 07:09.762
- Good fucking package...
- Piece of shit!

07:09.763 --> 07:11.536
<i>I was hooked in seconds.</i>

07:12.641 --> 07:14.618
<i>It was like mainlining adrenaline.</i>

07:14.726 --> 07:17.124
Yeah. Fuckface, look at where
the stock's at today, huh?

07:17.562 --> 07:19.790
You motherfucker,
you can't get any at 44...

07:20.148 --> 07:22.376
- Pick up the cocksucking phone!
- Sorry...

07:25.111 --> 07:27.213
You are such a fucking
douchebag, Hanna.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.199
We don't give two shits
about how technology works

07:30.200 --> 07:32.928
because all we care about
is getting fucking rich.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.305
- Solid, 2,000.
- Jordan Belfort.

07:36.706 --> 07:37.807
Done!

07:37.874 --> 07:40.209
Time to paint the tape. Whoo!

07:40.210 --> 07:43.689
2,000. Microsoft.
Going in the hole!

07:43.880 --> 07:45.197
Come on.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.989
Live. Live. Hold on, that is hot.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.720
In. In. Shut that motherfucker.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.993
Shut it! Shut it! Shut it!

07:53.014 --> 07:54.206
Sold!

08:12.409 --> 08:13.681
Yeah.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.102
Tootski?

08:22.627 --> 08:24.195
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

08:24.254 --> 08:27.198
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you
on this glorious afternoon?

08:27.340 --> 08:29.659
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.260
You're gonna bring us
two Absolut martinis.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.013
You know howl like them.
Straight up.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.724
And then precisely seven
and one half minutes after that,

08:36.725 --> 08:38.183
you're gonna bring us two more.

08:38.183 --> 08:41.520
Then two more after that
every five minutes

08:41.520 --> 08:43.715
until one of us
passes the fuck out.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.383
Excellent strategy, sir.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.261
I'm good with water for now.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.720
Thank you.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.716
It's his first day on Wall Street.
Give him time.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.518
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.811
Mr. Hanna?

08:58.204 --> 09:00.998
You're able to do
drugs during the day

09:00.999 --> 09:03.522
and then still function,
still do your job?

09:04.002 --> 09:05.961
How the fuck else would
you do this job?

09:05.962 --> 09:07.905
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.695
Right.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.801
Well, I got to say,
I'm incredibly excited

09:12.802 --> 09:15.075
to be a part of your firm.
I mean...

09:16.014 --> 09:17.681
The clients you have
are absolutely...

09:17.682 --> 09:19.079
Fuck the clients.

09:19.517 --> 09:22.917
Your only responsibility
is to put meat on the table.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.127
You got a girlfriend?

09:25.148 --> 09:26.815
I'm married. I have a wife.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.964
Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.360
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

09:30.361 --> 09:31.804
Think about Teresa.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.072
Name of the game.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.928
Move the money from your client's
pocket into your pocket.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.118
Right.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.870
But if you make your clients money
at the same time,

09:39.871 --> 09:42.269
it's advantageous to
everyone. Correct?

09:42.874 --> 09:44.066
No.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.895
Number one rule of Wall Street.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.068
Nobody...

09:49.255 --> 09:51.465
I don't care if you're Warren
Buffett or if you're Jimmy Buffett.

09:51.466 --> 09:54.176
Nobody knows if a
stock is gonna go up,

09:54.177 --> 09:56.178
down, sideways,
or in fucking circles.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.347
- Least of all stockbrokers, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.891
It's all a fugazi.
You know what a fugazi is?

10:00.892 --> 10:03.040
Uh. Fugayzi. It's a fake.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.896
Fugayzi, fugazi, it's a whazy,
it's a woozy, it's...

10:05.897 --> 10:08.357
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.359
It's never landed. It is no matter.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.819
It's not on the elemental chart.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.904
It's not fucking real.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.302
- Right?
- Right.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.262
- Stay with me.
- Mmm-hmm.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.019
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.120
No.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.164
So if you got a client
who bought stock at 8

10:24.165 --> 10:26.688
and it now sits at 16,
he's all fucking happy.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.127
He wants to cash in, liquidate,

10:28.128 --> 10:29.878
take his fucking
money and run home.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.902
- You don't let him do that.
- Okay.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.866
- 'Cause that would make it real.
- Right.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.217
No. What do you do?

10:35.218 --> 10:37.070
You get another brilliant idea.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.762
A special idea.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.265
Another "situation." Another stock

10:41.266 --> 10:43.392
to reinvest his
earnings and then some.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.712
And he will, every single time.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.751
'Cause they're fucking addicted.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.858
And you just keep doing this,
again and again and again.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.819
Meanwhile,
he thinks he's getting shit rich,

10:53.820 --> 10:55.797
which he is, on paper.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.739
But you and me, the brokers,

10:57.740 --> 10:59.616
we're taking home cold hard cash

10:59.617 --> 11:01.970
via commission, motherfucker.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.645
Right.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.915
That's incredible, sir.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.393
I can't tell you how excited I am.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.690
You should be.

11:09.711 --> 11:13.566
There's two keys to success
in the broker business.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.024
First of all...

11:17.135 --> 11:19.112
- You gotta stay relaxed.
- Yeah.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.829
Do you jerk off?

11:22.140 --> 11:23.807
Do I... Do I jerk off?

11:23.808 --> 11:26.127
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.541
How many times a week?

11:28.438 --> 11:30.439
Like, um, three or four.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.773
Three or four times, maybe five.

11:31.774 --> 11:32.816
Gotta pump those numbers up.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.152
Those are rookie numbers
in this racket.

11:35.153 --> 11:39.053
I myself, I jerk off
at least twice a day.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.782
- Wow.
- Once in the morning

11:40.783 --> 11:43.227
right after I work out,
then once right after lunch.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.846
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.516
I want to. That's not why I do it.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.855
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.461
Think about it.
You're dealing with numbers.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.505
All day long,
decimal points, high frequencies.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.607
Bang, bang, bang.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.152
Fucking digits.

11:59.594 --> 12:02.429
All very acidic
above-the-shoulders mustard shit.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.782
- All right?
- Mmm-hmm.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.140
It kind of wigs some people out.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.266
- Mmm-hmm.
- Right.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.643
You got to feed the geese
to keep the blood flowing.

12:07.644 --> 12:08.685
Mmm-hmm.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.520
I keep the rhythm below the belt.

12:10.521 --> 12:11.813
Done.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.398
This is not a tip, this
is a prescription.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.625
- Trust me.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:14.651 --> 12:17.236
If you don't, you will
fall out of balance,

12:17.237 --> 12:19.446
split your differential
and tip the fuck over.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.822
Or worse yet,

12:20.823 --> 12:22.641
I've seen this happen, implode.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.743
No, I don't want to implode, sir.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.953
No. No, you don't.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.246
I'm in it for the
long run, you know?

12:27.247 --> 12:28.849
- Implosions are ugly.
- Yeah.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.166
Pop off to the bathroom,
work one out any time you can.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.251
When you get really good at it,

12:32.252 --> 12:35.276
you'll fucking be stroking it
and you'll be thinking about money.

12:35.964 --> 12:40.634
Second key to success
in this racket

12:40.635 --> 12:41.969
is this little baby right here.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.447
It's called cocaine.

12:43.805 --> 12:44.930
Right.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.890
It'll keep you sharp
between the ears.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.959
It'll also help your
fingers dial faster.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.203
And guess what?

12:50.520 --> 12:52.122
That's good for me.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.627
Yes, sir.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.171
Revolutions. You follow?

12:56.192 --> 12:57.293
Revolutions.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.569
Keep the clients on
the Ferris wheel.

12:59.570 --> 13:03.198
And it goes. The park
is open 24/7, 365,

13:03.199 --> 13:06.223
every decade, every
goddamn century.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.641
That's it.

13:08.246 --> 13:09.518
The name of the game.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.146
Halkidiki?

13:12.250 --> 13:13.852
- Hmm.
- Thank you.

13:25.555 --> 13:26.656
Come on.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.541
We're the common denominator.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.675
Ah.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.012
Ah.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.965
Keep it up for me.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.949
<i>You've seen the echo</i>

13:45.950 --> 13:47.643
<i>And the money comes in</i>

13:48.119 --> 13:50.120
<i>The parade comes to town</i>

13:50.121 --> 13:51.955
<i>Going down Broadway</i>

13:51.956 --> 13:53.623
<i>It's a one-way street</i>

13:53.624 --> 13:55.021
<i>Whichever way I go</i>

13:59.005 --> 14:00.255
<i>The next six months,</i>

14:00.256 --> 14:02.674
<i>I got to know the ins and outs
of Wall Street.</i>

14:02.675 --> 14:06.370
<i>Earning shit money as I geared up
to take my Series 7.</i>

14:09.891 --> 14:11.208
Oh!

14:12.143 --> 14:13.369
Oh, fuckers.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.714
Oh!

14:20.443 --> 14:24.446
<i>Then I was a licensed
broker at last,</i>

14:24.447 --> 14:26.531
<i>ready to make my fortune.</i>

14:26.532 --> 14:31.229
<i>My first day as a future
Master of the Universe.</i>

14:38.002 --> 14:40.821
I have Exxon at 86
1/4 six months ago.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.256
Today it is trading at 36 1/2.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.529
Mr...

14:48.346 --> 14:50.889
<i>They called it Black Monday.</i>

14:50.890 --> 14:52.182
<i>No shit.</i>

14:52.183 --> 14:56.311
<i>By 4:00 p.m., the market
had dropped 508 points.</i>

14:56.312 --> 14:59.256
<i>The biggest plummet
since the crash of '29.</i>

14:59.273 --> 15:00.732
I know your family, you know mine.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.819
No, I don't know. Some fucking
country in Europe took a shit.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.237
Let them do
what they want to fucking do.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.571
Our market's solid.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.299
This is not something
that you want to sell.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.097
You know what happened?
A fucking tsunami.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.243
I think you're making
a big mistake.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.828
Yes, I will talk to your wife.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.538
Trust me, do not answer the phone.

15:14.539 --> 15:15.956
A lot of people are
gonna be calling you,

15:15.957 --> 15:17.149
trying to get your dirty laundry.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.417
We don't know what's going on here.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.770
I know. I know.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.198
Holy

15:32.890 --> 15:35.118
fucking shit!

15:36.853 --> 15:38.520
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

15:38.521 --> 15:41.064
<i>My first shitty day as a broker.</i>

15:41.065 --> 15:43.525
<i>Within a month, L.F. Rothschild,</i>

15:43.526 --> 15:48.382
<i>an institution since
1899, closed its doors.</i>

15:48.656 --> 15:50.866
<i>Wall Street had swallowed me up</i>

15:50.867 --> 15:53.345
<i>and shit me right back out again.</i>

15:56.456 --> 15:58.999
We could pawn my engagement ring
if we needed to.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.584
- Babe...
- Because I don't mind.

16:00.585 --> 16:01.751
If we needed to, I'm saying...

16:01.752 --> 16:03.378
- Will you listen to me?
- Okay.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.607
You're not pawning anything. Okay?

16:05.673 --> 16:07.048
- Okay.
- What do I always tell you?

16:07.049 --> 16:08.249
You're gonna be a millionaire.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.737
That's right. Okay?
Just let me look.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.034
We'll find something.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.763
- How about this?
- What?

16:13.764 --> 16:16.308
Nobody Beats the Wiz,
the electronics store.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.626
Stock boy. What do you think?

16:17.935 --> 16:19.207
You're not gonna
work at that place.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.312
Yeah, but, you know,
you start off...

16:20.313 --> 16:21.480
Jordan, you're gonna be
miserable at that place

16:21.481 --> 16:22.564
- if you go there.
- I know.

16:22.565 --> 16:23.815
It's sales. You work your way up,

16:23.816 --> 16:25.025
you'll be a general manager.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.735
- You're not gonna be a stock boy.
- Why not?

16:26.736 --> 16:28.258
'Cause you're a stockbroker.

16:28.654 --> 16:31.132
You understand that nobody's
hiring stockbrokers right now?

16:31.157 --> 16:32.509
You understand that?

16:32.658 --> 16:34.180
Okay?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.186
Ah. This place is.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.477
- What?
- What's that say?

16:42.627 --> 16:43.853
"Stockbrokers."

16:45.588 --> 16:46.796
In Long Island?
Stockbrokers in Long Island?

16:46.797 --> 16:48.023
Yeah.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.193
<i>It's in Long Island. So what?</i>

17:08.236 --> 17:12.011
Hey, uh, I'm looking
for Investor's Center.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.930
What's that? You want to invest?

17:15.201 --> 17:16.785
No. Investor's Center.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.058
I'm looking for Investor's Center.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.747
Yeah, yeah, that's us. Hey.
This is it. This is it.

17:20.748 --> 17:21.790
Oh.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.458
- I'm Dwayne. Yeah.
- You're Dwayne?

17:23.459 --> 17:25.402
Hi, Dwayne. We spoke on the phone.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.063
I'm Jordan Belfort.

17:27.088 --> 17:29.407
I'm the broker from Rothschild
in New York.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.241
Yes, yeah. Have a seat.
How are you?

17:31.592 --> 17:32.801
We had a conversation...

17:32.802 --> 17:34.135
We spoke on the phone
earlier, right?

17:34.136 --> 17:35.554
- Two hours ago.
- Right.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.656
Yeah.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.788
They're up and comers.
That's what that means.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.686
It's 3 cents a share, that's $3!

17:42.687 --> 17:44.255
You cheap fuck!

17:44.605 --> 17:46.189
So, uh...

17:46.190 --> 17:48.918
So where are your Quotrons here?

17:49.277 --> 17:51.194
- Quotrons?
- Yeah. Your computers.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.571
No, no.
We don't even need computers here.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.390
We just trade right off
the pink sheets here.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.266
- Pink sheets?
- Yeah, they're penny stocks.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.201
You know, uh, companies that
can't get listed on NASDAQ,

17:58.202 --> 17:59.474
they don't have enough capital?

17:59.495 --> 18:00.662
Their shares trade here.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.436
- Penny stocks?
- Yeah.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.417
This one, uh, Aerodyne,
is a really interesting...

18:05.418 --> 18:06.876
Or Aerotyne...

18:06.877 --> 18:08.445
Aerotyne, yeah.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.156
Aero... Aerotyne...

18:10.256 --> 18:11.590
Aerotyne. Yeah.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.799
Very hot stock right now.

18:12.800 --> 18:13.883
Oh, yeah?

18:13.884 --> 18:15.176
They're just a couple of brothers
that are making

18:15.177 --> 18:16.595
radar detectors out
of their garage.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.679
They're out in Dubuque.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.014
Maybe it's microwaves.
I'm not sure.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.515
But you call the
company's main line,

18:20.516 --> 18:22.434
their mom, Dorothy, answers
and she is so sweet.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.436
- Good company.
- I actually don't know what else to...

18:24.437 --> 18:26.557
I don't know anything else
about them other than that.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.962
Six cents a share?

18:29.442 --> 18:31.795
Hey, come on. Who buys this crap?

18:31.861 --> 18:33.008
Well, I mean...

18:33.195 --> 18:34.404
Honestly, mostly schmucks.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.507
Postmen, there's always postmen.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.491
Uh, plumbers. Um...

18:38.492 --> 18:40.035
They see our ads in
the back of, uh,

18:40.036 --> 18:41.620
<i>Hustler and Popular Mechanics.</i>

18:41.621 --> 18:44.565
Our ads actually say
they can get rich quick.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.832
<i>- Hustler?</i>
- Yeah.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.125
You know, those girlie magazines.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.694
Yeah, yeah. Nudie mag.

18:48.711 --> 18:49.878
- A lot.
- Yeah.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.588
We're helping them finance houses,

18:51.589 --> 18:53.548
we're helping them buy
their wife a diamond ring...

18:53.549 --> 18:54.716
A boat maybe.

18:54.717 --> 18:57.661
Is this... Is this stuff
regulated or are you guys...

18:57.678 --> 18:58.870
What are you doing here?

18:59.722 --> 19:00.948
Uh...

19:01.557 --> 19:02.749
Sort of.

19:02.892 --> 19:03.993
Sort of?

19:06.020 --> 19:08.229
Jesus Christ,
the spread on these is huge.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.606
Yeah. And that's
the point, that's...

19:09.607 --> 19:10.774
What's your name again?

19:10.775 --> 19:12.172
Mine... Jordan Belfort.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.132
Jordan, what do you get
on that blue chip stock?

19:14.278 --> 19:17.257
I make one percent.
Or I did make one percent.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.224
Pink sheets, it's 50.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.388
It's 50%?

19:24.080 --> 19:25.602
50% commission?

19:25.748 --> 19:27.191
- Yup.
- For what?

19:27.750 --> 19:29.568
It's our markup for our services.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.379
And so if I... If I...

19:32.380 --> 19:36.610
if I sell a stock at $10,000,
my commission is 5,000 bucks?

19:36.884 --> 19:39.135
If you sell $10,000
worth of this stock,

19:39.136 --> 19:41.409
I will personally give you
a blowjob for free.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.849
And I hope it happens.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.946
<i>Hello, John,
how are you doing today?</i>

19:48.979 --> 19:51.606
You mailed in my company
a postcard a few weeks back

19:51.607 --> 19:53.400
requesting information
on penny stocks

19:53.401 --> 19:55.527
that had huge upside potential

19:55.528 --> 19:57.278
with very little downside risk.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.280
- Does that ring a bell?
<i>- Yeah, I may have sent something.</i>

19:59.281 --> 20:02.492
Okay, great. The reason for
the call today, John, is,

20:02.493 --> 20:05.221
something just came
across my desk, John.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.621
It is perhaps the best thing

20:06.622 --> 20:08.123
I've seen in the last six months.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.999
If you have 60 seconds,
I'd like to share

20:10.000 --> 20:11.292
the idea with you.
You got a minute?

20:11.293 --> 20:12.419
<i>Actually, I'm really very...</i>

20:12.420 --> 20:14.963
The name of the company,
Aerotyne International.

20:14.964 --> 20:18.318
It is a cutting edge high-tech firm
out of the Midwest

20:18.467 --> 20:20.385
<i>awaiting imminent patent approval</i>

20:20.386 --> 20:22.971
on the next generation
of radar detectors

20:22.972 --> 20:27.578
that have both huge military
and civilian applications now.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.977
Right now, John,

20:28.978 --> 20:31.438
the stock trades over-the-counter
at 10 cents a share.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.815
And by the way, John,
our analysts indicate

20:33.816 --> 20:36.192
it could go a heck of
a lot higher than that.

20:36.193 --> 20:39.237
Your profit on a mere
$6,000 investment

20:39.238 --> 20:42.262
would be upwards of $60,000!

20:42.366 --> 20:43.867
<i>Jesus! That's my mortgage, man.</i>

20:43.868 --> 20:45.535
Exactly.
You could pay off your mortgage.

20:45.536 --> 20:47.120
<i>This stock will pay off my house?</i>

20:47.121 --> 20:48.997
John, one thing I can promise you,

20:48.998 --> 20:50.315
even in this market,

20:50.332 --> 20:52.125
is that I never ask my clients

20:52.126 --> 20:53.603
to judge me on my winners.

20:54.003 --> 20:57.573
I ask them to judge me on my losers
because I have so few.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.215
And in the case of Aerotyne,

20:59.216 --> 21:01.926
based on every technical
factor out there, John,

21:01.927 --> 21:05.156
we are looking at
a grand slam home run.

21:05.389 --> 21:08.099
<i>Okay, let's do it. I'll do 4 grand.</i>

21:08.100 --> 21:10.419
$4,000? That'd be
40,000 shares, John.

21:10.478 --> 21:11.936
Let me lock in that trade right now

21:11.937 --> 21:13.313
and get back to you
with my secretary

21:13.314 --> 21:15.315
with an exact confirmation.
Sound good, John?

21:15.316 --> 21:16.668
<i>- Yeah, sounds good.</i>
- Great.

21:16.734 --> 21:17.901
Hey, John.

21:17.902 --> 21:19.549
Thank you for your
vote of confidence.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.529
And welcome to the
Investor's Center.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.677
<i>Yeah, thanks a lot, man.</i>

21:22.782 --> 21:24.099
Bye-bye.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.162
How'd you fucking do that?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.917
<i>Just like that, I made 2 grand.</i>

21:33.918 --> 21:36.817
<i>The other guys looked at me
like I'd just discovered fire.</i>

21:38.214 --> 21:39.611
Great! Even better!

21:39.632 --> 21:41.716
<i>I was selling garbage
to garbage men</i>

21:41.717 --> 21:43.319
<i>and making cash hand over fist.</i>

21:43.594 --> 21:46.074
The only problem you're gonna
have is that you didn't buy more.

21:46.597 --> 21:47.972
Boom shocka locka!

21:47.973 --> 21:50.016
<i>So I was selling them shit.</i>

21:50.017 --> 21:53.520
<i>But the way I looked at it, their
money was better off in my pocket.</i>

21:53.521 --> 21:55.464
<i>I knew how to spend it better.</i>

21:55.815 --> 21:58.213
<i>Excuse me.
Is that your car in the lot?</i>

21:58.400 --> 21:59.717
Yeah.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.754
<i>- It's a nice ride.
- Thanks, man.</i>

22:01.862 --> 22:03.009
Donnie Azoff.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.155
Hey. I'm Jordan Belfort.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.517
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

22:05.533 --> 22:07.408
You know, actually,
I see that car around.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.182
- I see it around a lot.
- Oh, yeah, where?

22:09.203 --> 22:11.079
I think we live in
the same building.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.247
- No shit?
- Yeah, yeah.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.066
- Twelfth floor?
- Yeah. What floor are you on?

22:14.083 --> 22:15.250
Fourth floor.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.194
- I have two little kids. Ugly wife.
- Right.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.193
What do you do, bro?

22:21.423 --> 22:23.196
What do you mean, what do I do?

22:23.217 --> 22:24.467
For work, what do you do?

22:24.468 --> 22:25.694
I'm a stockbroker.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.576
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.244
Children's furniture.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.598
Oh, good for you.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.042
It's all right.

22:32.268 --> 22:33.620
You make a lot of money?

22:35.062 --> 22:36.755
Yeah, I do all right for myself.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.089
I'm trying to put it together.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.566
You got your fucking nice car,

22:39.567 --> 22:41.109
we live in the same
building. I just...

22:41.110 --> 22:43.804
I'm not understanding...
How much money do you make?

22:45.489 --> 22:47.683
I don't know. $70,000 last month.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.560
Get the fuck...

22:49.743 --> 22:51.390
Get the fuck out of here.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.767
No, I'm serious.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.060
Yeah, no, I'm serious, too.

22:54.248 --> 22:56.225
Seriously,
how much money do you make?

22:56.417 --> 22:58.565
I told you. $70,000.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.234
Well, technically, $72,000.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.240
Last month. Something like that.

23:04.174 --> 23:06.301
You made 72 grand in one month?

23:06.302 --> 23:07.574
Yeah.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.291
I'll tell you what.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.477
You show me a pay stub
for $72,000 on it,

23:16.478 --> 23:18.831
I quit my job right now
and I work for you.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.305
<i>Hey, Paulie, what's up?</i>

23:28.324 --> 23:29.721
No, yeah, yeah.
No, everything's fine.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.219
Hey, listen, I quit.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.179
<i>And he did quit his job.</i>

23:33.203 --> 23:34.454
<i>Which I thought was a little weird.</i>

23:34.455 --> 23:36.228
<i>I mean, I just met
this fucking guy.</i>

23:36.415 --> 23:38.188
Don't fucking tell Susan.
It's none of her business.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.584
<i>There were other
things about him, too.</i>

23:39.585 --> 23:41.794
<i>Like his phosphorescent
white teeth.</i>

23:41.795 --> 23:43.046
wife! I gotta fucking
deal with your wife?

23:43.047 --> 23:45.298
<i>The fact that he wore horn rims
with clear lenses</i>

23:45.299 --> 23:47.151
<i>just to look more WASP-y.</i>

23:47.343 --> 23:50.287
<i>And then, there were these rumors.</i>

23:50.763 --> 23:53.014
I heard some stupid shit.
I don't know.

23:53.015 --> 23:55.413
Fuck, I didn't even want
to bring it up. It's just...

23:55.517 --> 23:57.460
- it's stupid.
- Shit with me?

23:57.478 --> 23:59.687
You know, people say shit.
I don't even know.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.211
I don't even listen
to it half the time.

24:02.650 --> 24:03.876
What are they saying?

24:04.526 --> 24:07.362
Shit about you and your cousin
or something like that.

24:07.363 --> 24:08.696
I don't even listen to it.

24:08.697 --> 24:11.346
Oh, bro, it's not like that.

24:11.367 --> 24:12.684
It's not like that.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.687
Like you married your cousin
or some stupid shit. No?

24:16.538 --> 24:17.664
Yeah, my wife. Yeah.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.582
My wife is my cousin, or whatever.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.186
But it's not like what you think,
or whatever, you know.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.362
Is she like a first
cousin, or is she...

24:24.380 --> 24:25.546
Yeah, no, she's, you know...

24:25.547 --> 24:27.570
Her... Her father

24:28.217 --> 24:30.490
is the brother of my mom.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.203
It's not like, what... You know.

24:32.221 --> 24:33.538
Look, we grew up together.

24:33.639 --> 24:36.224
And she grew up hot, you know.
She fucking grew up hot.

24:36.225 --> 24:38.059
And all my friends were
trying to fuck her, you know.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.753
And I'm not gonna let someone...

24:40.062 --> 24:41.729
You know, one of these
assholes fuck my cousin,

24:41.730 --> 24:43.815
so, you know, I used
the cousin thing

24:43.816 --> 24:45.293
as like an in with her.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.860
I'm not gonna let someone
else fuck my cousin.

24:47.861 --> 24:49.612
You know,
if anyone's gonna fuck my cousin,

24:49.613 --> 24:51.572
it's gonna be me, out of respect.
You know?

24:51.573 --> 24:52.740
No, I get it. Yeah.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.060
I mean, you're not afraid of
like the whole kid thing, right?

24:55.077 --> 24:56.327
- What? Having kids with her?
- Yeah.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.645
No. We have two kids.

24:57.788 --> 24:59.163
And they're... I mean...

24:59.164 --> 25:01.833
I don't want to get personal,
but they're okay?

25:01.834 --> 25:04.028
No, they're not retarded
or anything like that.

25:04.086 --> 25:06.029
But there's a big
chance, right, if...

25:06.046 --> 25:08.423
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

25:08.424 --> 25:12.028
60 to 65% chance the kid's gonna
be fucking retarded or whatever.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.244
That'd scare the shit
out of me, buddy.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.638
Look, man, a lot of having a kid,
or whatever, takes risk,

25:15.639 --> 25:17.432
whether you're fucking
cousins or not.

25:17.433 --> 25:20.268
What if something
like that happened?

25:20.269 --> 25:21.936
Basically, you know,
if the kid was retarded,

25:21.937 --> 25:25.356
I would, you know,
drive it up to the country

25:25.357 --> 25:27.108
and just, like, you know,
open the door and say,

25:27.109 --> 25:29.382
"You're free now."
You know, like, "Run free."

25:29.778 --> 25:30.879
You know?

25:35.576 --> 25:37.160
You're completely fucking with me.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.728
That's horrible.
You're not gonna...

25:41.749 --> 25:43.416
You look like you've... No.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.334
We would take it to,
like, an institution or somewhere

25:45.335 --> 25:46.586
that's handled to, like, you know,

25:46.587 --> 25:48.234
raise the kid or whatever.

25:48.589 --> 25:50.840
You know what? If you're
happy, God bless you, buddy.

25:50.841 --> 25:52.008
No, I'm not fucking happy.

25:52.009 --> 25:54.237
No one who's married
is fucking happy.

25:54.303 --> 25:55.905
Well, I'm sorry to
hear that, buddy.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.181
Listen, I'm really, you know...

25:58.182 --> 26:00.580
I'm really appreciative
for this fucking job.

26:00.642 --> 26:01.851
I'm really enjoying it.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.352
I'm really happy with
what you're doing.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.501
Actually, I got you
a little present.

26:05.773 --> 26:07.231
- You got me a present?
- I got you something.

26:07.232 --> 26:08.584
Oh, fuck. You're sweet.

26:08.650 --> 26:09.850
Yeah. It's in the back though.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.425
- What do you mean?
- You gotta go out back.

26:12.863 --> 26:14.806
Like it's wrapped up or something?

26:14.823 --> 26:16.365
It's wrapped up. Yeah.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.575
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.144
Let's fucking go. Come on.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.329
Your turn.

26:21.330 --> 26:22.413
I'm not fucking doing this.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.561
You're out of your fucking mind.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.583
- Smoke this shit, bro.
- No.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.668
No one's fucking here, bro.

26:27.669 --> 26:28.816
Get the fuck...

26:29.046 --> 26:30.671
Fucking smoke crack with me, bro.

26:30.672 --> 26:31.839
I'm not fucking doing it.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.675
Smoke crack. Smoke some
fucking crack with me, bro.

26:34.676 --> 26:37.120
- One hit. One hit. That's it.
- Okay.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.114
Fucking nut job.

27:01.203 --> 27:02.896
Wow!

27:05.332 --> 27:06.649
Wow.

27:10.254 --> 27:11.697
Let's go run, huh?

27:12.005 --> 27:13.903
We gotta get out of here, buddy.

27:14.216 --> 27:16.717
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go fucking run.

27:16.718 --> 27:20.288
Let's run like we're fucking lions
and tigers and bears!

27:20.430 --> 27:22.828
Let's run! Let's fucking run!

27:23.142 --> 27:24.960
Let's fucking run! Go!

27:24.977 --> 27:26.394
Go, go, go, go!

27:27.729 --> 27:29.856
<i>You've reached
Frank's Best Auto Body.</i>

27:29.857 --> 27:31.399
<i>We're closed right now.</i>

27:31.400 --> 27:33.502
<i>So please leave us a message.</i>

27:33.527 --> 27:35.278
<i>Hello. My name is Jordan Belfort.</i>

27:35.279 --> 27:38.739
<i>My partner and I are very interested
in renting out your garage.</i>

27:38.740 --> 27:41.325
<i>Donnie and I were
going out on our own.</i>

27:41.326 --> 27:43.744
<i>And the first thing
we needed was brokers.</i>

27:43.745 --> 27:45.746
<i>Guys with sales experience.</i>

27:45.747 --> 27:47.748
<i>So I recruited some
of my hometown boys.</i>

27:47.749 --> 27:49.792
<i>Sea Otter, who sold meat</i>

27:49.793 --> 27:51.002
<i>and weed.</i>

27:51.003 --> 27:53.296
<i>Chester, who sold tires</i>

27:53.297 --> 27:54.463
<i>and weed.</i>

27:54.464 --> 27:57.408
<i>And Robbie, who sold anything
he could get his hands on.</i>

27:57.509 --> 27:58.781
<i>Mostly weed.</i>

27:59.261 --> 28:01.409
Can you bring me some ketchup?
Okay?

28:01.722 --> 28:02.889
<i>This is Brad.</i>

28:02.890 --> 28:04.640
<i>And Brad's the guy
I really wanted.</i>

28:04.641 --> 28:05.975
<i>But he didn't go along with us.</i>

28:05.976 --> 28:08.603
<i>He was already making so much
money selling Quaaludes,</i>

28:08.604 --> 28:11.439
<i>he'd become the Quaalude king
of Bayside.</i>

28:11.440 --> 28:12.607
Getting any pussy
with that thing or what?

28:12.608 --> 28:13.649
Yeah, man, of course.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.610
Bring some of them chicks
around here sometime, huh?

28:15.611 --> 28:16.986
Let 'em watch.

28:16.987 --> 28:18.930
Let 'em watch. Know what I mean?

28:19.323 --> 28:23.018
Hey, Zip! You tell your sister
I was asking about her.

28:23.285 --> 28:26.264
Why don't you bring me a pair of her
panties next time you come through.

28:26.455 --> 28:29.183
Yeah, man. She said she don't
want to talk to you anymore, man.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.614
Get the fuck out of here.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.736
Hey, Ma, we got chicken or what?

28:34.630 --> 28:35.822
Ma!

28:36.381 --> 28:38.483
You listening?
It's easier than you think.

28:38.508 --> 28:39.967
Every person you're
on the phone with,

28:39.968 --> 28:42.595
they want to get rich
and they want to get rich quickly.

28:42.596 --> 28:43.804
They all want something
for nothing.

28:43.805 --> 28:46.390
There was this one time that I was
selling pot to this Amish dude.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.850
You know those guys
who got like the beard

28:47.851 --> 28:49.999
with like no mustache
or some bullshit?

28:50.479 --> 28:53.924
Well, he says that he only
wants to make furniture.

28:54.483 --> 28:55.524
I don't understand.

28:55.525 --> 28:56.797
What's that
got to do with anything?

28:56.860 --> 28:58.758
What the fuck are
you talking about?

28:58.987 --> 29:00.696
I'm not putting words
in your mouth or nothing,

29:00.697 --> 29:03.926
but you just said that
everybody wants to get rich.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.470
Holy fuck, you did just say that.

29:07.037 --> 29:08.829
What the fuck are
you talking about?

29:08.830 --> 29:09.997
Yeah, like Buddhists.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.040
They don't give a shit about money.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.125
They're wrapped in sheets.
They're not buying shit.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.961
I'm not talking about
Buddhists or Amish.

29:14.962 --> 29:16.420
I'm talking about normal people,

29:16.421 --> 29:17.797
working-class, everyday people.

29:17.798 --> 29:19.799
Everyone wants to
get rich. Am I crazy?

29:19.800 --> 29:21.175
There's no such thing
as an Amish Buddhist.

29:21.176 --> 29:23.119
- I'm pretty fucking sure.
- There could be.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.471
Can we get some ketchup, please?

29:25.472 --> 29:26.931
Do you guys not want to make money?

29:26.932 --> 29:28.724
I want to make some money.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.142
I want to make some
fucking money, okay.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.460
I can sell anything.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.521
Shit, I can sell ludes
to a convent full of nuns,

29:33.522 --> 29:35.522
and get them so horny
they'd be fucking each other.

29:35.565 --> 29:37.463
That's the attitude.
You can sell anything?

29:37.484 --> 29:39.151
Sell me this fucking
pen right here.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.903
You can sell anything.
Sell that. Go ahead.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.176
Sell me the pen.

29:42.864 --> 29:44.966
Can I finish eating first?
I haven't eaten today.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.431
Brad, show them how
it's done. Boom.

29:47.452 --> 29:48.974
Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.621
You want me to sell
this fucking pen?

29:50.622 --> 29:52.975
That's my boy right there.
Can fucking sell anything.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.208
Why don't you do me a favor.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.889
Write your name down
on that napkin for me.

29:55.961 --> 29:57.086
I don't have a pen.

29:57.087 --> 29:59.155
Exactly. Supply and
demand, my friend.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.298
Holy shit.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.590
See what I'm saying?
He's creating urgency.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.009
Get them to want to buy the stock.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.885
Convince them it's something
they need, you know what I mean?

30:04.886 --> 30:06.238
And that's the thing.

30:06.388 --> 30:07.990
All nuns are lesbians.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.849
What the fuck are you
talking about, Otter?

30:09.850 --> 30:11.475
Think about it.
They can't keep a dude

30:11.476 --> 30:12.727
so they're gonna start
fucking chicks.

30:12.728 --> 30:15.001
Four fucking times,
Kimmie! Four times.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.480
- He's not with us.
- Friggin' Rambo.

30:16.481 --> 30:17.924
Now she runs.

30:17.941 --> 30:20.885
<i>But look. I knew these
guys weren't like Harvard MBAs.</i>

30:20.902 --> 30:22.570
<i>Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,</i>

30:22.571 --> 30:24.864
<i>took five years to
finish high school.</i>

30:24.865 --> 30:26.699
<i>Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter,</i>

30:26.700 --> 30:27.892
<i>didn't even graduate.</i>

30:28.035 --> 30:30.077
<i>Chester Ming, the
depraved Chinaman,</i>

30:30.078 --> 30:32.226
<i>thought jujitsu was in Israel.</i>

30:32.331 --> 30:34.749
<i>Smartest of the bunch
was Nicky Koskoff.</i>

30:34.750 --> 30:36.500
<i>He actually went to law school.</i>

30:36.501 --> 30:40.026
<i>I called him Rugrat because of
his piece of shit hairpiece.</i>

30:40.630 --> 30:43.924
<i>Still, give them to me young,
hungry and stupid</i>

30:43.925 --> 30:47.074
<i>and in no time,
I'll make them rich.</i>

30:49.097 --> 30:50.494
Oh, my God.

30:50.682 --> 30:51.874
Jordan, that...

30:52.100 --> 30:53.267
You like it, baby?

30:53.268 --> 30:55.120
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.605
They're not the biggest stones
in the world,

30:57.606 --> 30:59.583
but I promise they're
really high quality.

30:59.691 --> 31:00.838
It's beautiful.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.920
They're so beautiful.

31:03.487 --> 31:04.634
Oh, boy.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.113
What?

31:06.114 --> 31:08.699
I know that look.
What is it? Go ahead.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.427
I don't know, it's... You know...

31:10.952 --> 31:13.350
These stocks... These companies...

31:13.789 --> 31:15.456
They're like crappy companies.

31:15.457 --> 31:16.854
- Well, yeah.
- Okay.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.318
Yeah, they're terrible.

31:19.086 --> 31:20.461
Don't worry about it. I told you,

31:20.462 --> 31:21.862
what I'm doing is completely legal.

31:21.880 --> 31:22.963
Yeah, I know.

31:22.964 --> 31:25.237
But they're not gonna make
anyone money though, right?

31:25.967 --> 31:28.094
Well, sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.

31:28.095 --> 31:29.572
You know how it goes.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.223
Wouldn't you feel better if you
sold that stuff to rich people

31:32.224 --> 31:34.577
who can, like,
afford to lose all that money?

31:36.436 --> 31:37.583
Of course.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.711
But rich people don't
buy penny stocks.

31:41.191 --> 31:42.668
They just don't.

31:42.943 --> 31:44.295
Why not?

31:46.196 --> 31:48.155
<i>Because they're too smart,</i>

31:48.156 --> 31:49.508
<i>that's why not.</i>

31:49.533 --> 31:52.535
<i>I mean, what person with
a college education</i>

31:52.536 --> 31:53.911
<i>would trust this
bunch of jerk-offs?</i>

31:53.912 --> 31:55.162
Hang up the phone.
Tell him you'll call him back.

31:55.163 --> 31:56.330
I got 5 fucking grand
on the phone right now!

31:56.331 --> 31:57.581
Hey!

31:57.582 --> 32:00.626
<i>But what if they didn't sound
like a bunch of jerk-offs?</i>

32:00.627 --> 32:03.947
<i>What if I could teach them
how to sell to people with money?</i>

32:04.005 --> 32:05.527
<i>Real money.</i>

32:06.091 --> 32:08.034
<i>So I decided to
reinvent the company.</i>

32:08.260 --> 32:10.454
Gentlemen, welcome

32:11.138 --> 32:13.366
to Stratton Oakmont.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.291
You schnooks will now be targeting

32:15.308 --> 32:18.503
the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.630
We're talking about whales here.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.624
Moby fucking Dicks.

32:22.649 --> 32:26.861
And with this script,
which is now your new harpoon,

32:26.862 --> 32:29.071
I'm gonna teach
each and every one of you

32:29.072 --> 32:31.800
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.555
Get it? Huh?

32:33.577 --> 32:34.803
Captain who?

32:34.995 --> 32:36.472
Captain Ahab. From the fucking...

32:38.206 --> 32:40.149
The book, motherfucker.
From the book.

32:40.167 --> 32:42.209
Turn your fucking brain on.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.627
- Fuck you.
- Jesus fuck, Robbie.

32:43.628 --> 32:46.698
Listen to me. We're a
new company with a new name.

32:46.715 --> 32:49.785
A company that our
clients can believe in.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.863
A company that our
clients can trust.

32:53.013 --> 32:57.641
A firm whose roots are
so deeply embedded into Wall Street

32:57.642 --> 33:01.145
that our very founders sailed over
on the Mayflower

33:01.146 --> 33:03.044
and chiseled the name
Stratton Oakmont

33:03.064 --> 33:05.462
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!

33:05.567 --> 33:07.169
You got it?

33:07.235 --> 33:09.069
What we're gonna do is this.

33:09.070 --> 33:12.364
First we pitch 'em
Disney, AT&T, IBM,

33:12.365 --> 33:14.325
blue chip stocks exclusively.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.599
Companies these people know.

33:16.745 --> 33:20.691
Once we've suckered them in,
we unload the dog shit.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.875
The pink sheets, the penny stocks,

33:22.876 --> 33:24.523
where we make the money.

33:24.628 --> 33:26.730
- 50% commission, baby.
- Ooh.

33:26.963 --> 33:29.840
Now the key to making money
in a situation like this

33:29.841 --> 33:32.945
is to position yourself now
before the settlement.

33:33.053 --> 33:35.930
Because by the time you read about
it in <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i>

33:35.931 --> 33:37.874
it's already too late.

33:38.558 --> 33:40.100
Then you wait.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.268
You wait.

33:41.269 --> 33:43.963
And whoever speaks first loses.

33:45.899 --> 33:47.216
<i>Sorry, uh...</i>

33:47.275 --> 33:48.797
<i>I appreciate the call.</i>

33:48.818 --> 33:51.237
<i>I really have to give
this some thought</i>

33:51.238 --> 33:53.072
<i>and talk to my wife about it.</i>

33:53.073 --> 33:54.265
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

33:54.449 --> 33:55.866
They don't know, right?
They gotta think about it,

33:55.867 --> 33:58.285
they gotta talk to their fucking
wives, or the fucking Tooth Fairy.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.204
Point is, it doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

34:00.205 --> 34:03.791
The only real objection that they have
is that they don't trust you guys.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.501
And why should they trust you?
I mean, look at you.

34:05.502 --> 34:07.422
You're a bunch of fucking
sleazy salesmen, right?

34:08.420 --> 34:10.089
So, what do you say?

34:10.090 --> 34:13.342
You mean to tell me that if I put
you in at Union Carbide at 7

34:13.342 --> 34:14.864
and took you out at 32...

34:14.928 --> 34:17.513
Texas Instruments at 11
and took you out at 47...

34:17.514 --> 34:20.181
U.S. Steel at 16,
took you out at 41...

34:20.183 --> 34:21.809
You wouldn't be saying
to me right now, "Chester,

34:21.810 --> 34:23.686
"pick me up a few thousand
shares of Disney

34:23.687 --> 34:25.414
"on the spot, right now. Come on."

34:25.855 --> 34:27.313
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly?
Seriously?

34:27.315 --> 34:28.732
<i>I don't know you.</i>

34:28.733 --> 34:31.085
<i>You cold-called me.
You're a total stranger.</i>

34:31.194 --> 34:32.277
I am in complete
agreement with you.

34:32.279 --> 34:34.052
You don't know me,
I don't know you.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.281
Let me introduce myself to you.

34:35.282 --> 34:36.739
My name is Alden Kupferberg.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.184
- Robbie Feinberg.
- Chester Ming.

34:38.201 --> 34:40.077
I'm Senior Vice President
at Stratton Oakmont...

34:40.078 --> 34:41.579
and I plan on being one of the...

34:41.580 --> 34:43.956
top brokers in my firm next year.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.996
And I'm not gonna get there
by being wrong, Stanley.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.043
<i>I do wanna say that
you sound like a...</i>

34:48.043 --> 34:49.878
<i>You sound like a
pretty sincere guy.</i>

34:49.879 --> 34:51.045
<i>It's not gonna make you rich</i>

34:51.047 --> 34:52.172
<i>and it's not gonna make you poor.</i>

34:52.172 --> 34:54.742
But what this trade
will do is serve as...

34:54.759 --> 34:57.112
a benchmark
for future business, Kevin.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.013
You feel comfortable
with me now, Scotty?

34:59.014 --> 35:00.347
And then you'll know for sure

35:00.348 --> 35:02.516
that you finally found
a broker on Wall Street

35:02.517 --> 35:04.143
that you can trust,

35:04.144 --> 35:07.839
and who can consistently
make you money.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.340
Sound fair enough?

35:11.359 --> 35:13.336
<i>You know what... Yeah.</i>

35:14.112 --> 35:15.964
<i>I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed.</i>

35:17.741 --> 35:19.116
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

35:19.117 --> 35:20.218
Kevin.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.745
You give me one shot here

35:22.746 --> 35:25.456
on a blue chip stock like Kodak,

35:25.457 --> 35:27.708
and believe me, Kevin,

35:27.709 --> 35:30.336
the only problem you're gonna have

35:30.337 --> 35:32.860
is that you didn't buy more.

35:32.922 --> 35:34.490
Sound fair enough?

35:35.884 --> 35:37.076
<i>Shit. My...</i>

35:39.220 --> 35:40.492
<i>Uh...</i>

35:40.889 --> 35:42.616
<i>My wife might divorce me, but...</i>

35:42.641 --> 35:43.833
<i>Yeah, let's do it.</i>

35:45.435 --> 35:46.935
Excellent choice, Kevin.

35:46.936 --> 35:48.834
How much do you
want to go for this time?

35:48.938 --> 35:50.898
<i>Let's do 5... $5,000.</i>

35:50.899 --> 35:52.149
Can we try 8,000, Kevin?

35:52.150 --> 35:53.593
<i>All right. Let's do 10.</i>

35:53.735 --> 35:54.902
<i>- Ten.
- You want to do that?</i>

35:54.903 --> 35:55.986
Excellent choice!

35:55.987 --> 35:57.488
Kevin, let me lock in
that trade right now

35:57.489 --> 35:58.781
and get back to you
in a few minutes

35:58.782 --> 36:00.240
with an exact confirmation, Kevin.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.910
And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

36:02.911 --> 36:05.184
<i>Thanks, man. I'm gonna have a beer.</i>

36:05.246 --> 36:06.413
<i>This is fun.</i>

36:06.414 --> 36:07.686
Take it easy, Kev.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.692
<i>Hey, thanks, Jordan. Thanks a...</i>

36:10.377 --> 36:12.400
Fuck that motherfucker!

36:12.504 --> 36:14.356
That's what I'm talking about!

36:17.717 --> 36:19.114
What a fucking idiot.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.660
The one thing I know about
in this world is airlines.

36:22.889 --> 36:26.118
And Cuchon Airlines
is the future of airlines.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.334
Get in now or...

36:27.435 --> 36:29.103
- I'm Nicky Koskoff...
- Chester Ming...

36:29.104 --> 36:30.396
and I'm a Senior Vice President

36:30.397 --> 36:31.714
with Stratton Oakmont.

36:32.399 --> 36:35.969
Judy, I am so, so, so
sorry for your loss.

36:36.277 --> 36:37.486
When did he pass?

36:37.487 --> 36:38.570
Just say I'm wrong, right.

36:38.571 --> 36:39.697
And the stock goes down
a couple points...

36:39.698 --> 36:41.281
and it makes you,
in the words of my grandfather,

36:41.282 --> 36:44.159
God rest his soul,
"A shit ton of money."

36:44.160 --> 36:45.369
It's like getting in
on fucking sunlight

36:45.370 --> 36:47.017
before there was fucking sunlight.
You understand?

36:47.122 --> 36:48.914
<i>Can we do 8,000 shares?</i>

36:48.915 --> 36:50.483
<i>Okay, 25,000.</i>

36:52.252 --> 36:53.585
That's a very intelligent decision.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.346
I'm gonna transfer you
to my sales associate.

36:56.131 --> 36:57.232
Rhonda!

36:57.882 --> 36:59.258
- Rhonda!
- ...put you through to Andrea.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.077
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?

37:07.434 --> 37:08.809
<i>Everybody have a good week?</i>

37:08.810 --> 37:10.002
Yeah!

37:11.271 --> 37:12.479
<i>The end of the month.</i>

37:12.480 --> 37:16.150
<i>$28.7 million in gross commissions,</i>

37:16.151 --> 37:18.970
<i>all from pink sheet stock, boys!</i>

37:20.613 --> 37:23.699
<i>And to celebrate with our
weekly act of debauchery,</i>

37:23.700 --> 37:25.534
<i>I have offered our
lovely sales assistant,</i>

37:25.535 --> 37:27.536
<i>Danielle Harrison, here,</i>

37:27.537 --> 37:31.331
<i>$10,000 to shave her fucking head!</i>

37:31.332 --> 37:32.558
Yeah!

37:34.419 --> 37:36.112
Yeah, you want this?

37:36.171 --> 37:37.272
You want this?

37:37.338 --> 37:39.782
<i>Let's scalp her! Scalp her!</i>

37:39.924 --> 37:42.176
Let the scalping begin!

37:45.847 --> 37:47.290
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

37:49.142 --> 37:51.435
<i>FYI, boys, Danielle has promised</i>

37:51.436 --> 37:54.480
<i>to use this $10,000
for breast implants!</i>

37:54.481 --> 37:55.898
<i>She's already got C cups,</i>

37:55.899 --> 37:58.001
<i>but now she wants
fucking double D's!</i>

37:58.067 --> 38:00.716
<i>Is this a great fucking
company or what?</i>

38:03.072 --> 38:06.051
<i>Is this the greatest company
in the world?</i>

38:09.078 --> 38:10.475
<i>Donnie!</i>

38:10.538 --> 38:13.983
<i>Blow the roof off
this motherfucker!</i>

38:42.737 --> 38:44.259
- Champagne?
- Whoo!

38:48.117 --> 38:50.640
<i>Send in the stripees!</i>

39:24.946 --> 39:26.047
Mine!

39:41.045 --> 39:44.756
<i>Word about us
spread throughout Wall Street.</i>

39:44.757 --> 39:46.734
<i>Even the places I
didn't want it to.</i>

39:56.269 --> 39:58.812
<i>It wasn't long before
Forbes magazine,</i>

39:58.813 --> 40:01.648
<i>the flagship of Wall Street,
called to do a profile on me.</i>

40:01.649 --> 40:05.068
Let me ask you, how do you see
the future for Stratton Oakmont?

40:05.069 --> 40:06.341
One word?

40:07.989 --> 40:10.137
Diversification.

40:10.825 --> 40:12.200
Sounds good. Thank you so much.
I have more than enough.

40:12.201 --> 40:13.285
- I appreciate your time.
- Fantastic.

40:13.286 --> 40:14.387
Can we get a quick picture?

40:15.830 --> 40:18.934
<i>A total fucking hatchet job.</i>

40:19.000 --> 40:21.148
<i>This conniving little twat!
Look at this!</i>

40:21.294 --> 40:24.147
"The Wolf of Wall Street"
they call me. Look.

40:24.172 --> 40:25.319
Your hair looks good.

40:25.340 --> 40:26.882
- Well, my hair looks good.
- Yeah.

40:26.883 --> 40:28.342
"Jordan Belfort,

40:28.343 --> 40:30.928
"sounding like a kind
of twisted Robin Hood

40:30.929 --> 40:33.657
"who takes from the rich
and gives to himself

40:33.681 --> 40:35.515
"and his merry little
band of brokers."

40:35.516 --> 40:36.993
- Read that. Read it.
- Listen.

40:37.185 --> 40:40.896
There is no such thing as
bad publicity, sweetheart.

40:40.897 --> 40:42.340
Read the article, babe.

40:42.565 --> 40:45.043
Jordan, you look great!
You're in a huge magazine.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.420
Big fucking deal I look great.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.321
Mr. Belfort!
Can you look at my resume, please?

40:49.322 --> 40:51.345
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

40:53.618 --> 40:55.220
Calm the fuck down!

40:55.703 --> 40:57.100
What the hell's all this?

40:57.205 --> 41:00.024
It's the Forbes article.
They all want to work for you now.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.208
Hey! What did I say?

41:01.209 --> 41:02.526
I'm just trying to be nice.

41:02.752 --> 41:05.446
Hey, you want a job,
you talk to me!

41:05.713 --> 41:06.814
- Mr. Belfort!
- Give me one minute.

41:06.881 --> 41:09.530
Forbes made me a superstar.

41:10.635 --> 41:15.582
<i>Every day, dozens of money-crazed
kids beat a path to my door.</i>

41:16.349 --> 41:19.559
<i>If we hired 'em, they dropped
straight out of college overnight</i>

41:19.560 --> 41:21.269
<i>and spent whatever
allowance they had</i>

41:21.270 --> 41:23.772
<i>on a new suit from
our Stratton tailor.</i>

41:23.773 --> 41:25.420
Are you fucking serious right now?

41:25.817 --> 41:29.592
<i>I mean, we were literally putting
clothes on these kids' backs.</i>

41:29.612 --> 41:32.215
<i>And here comes this jerk-off
sniffing around.</i>

41:32.740 --> 41:35.909
<i>But, you know, every time
someone rises up in this world,</i>

41:35.910 --> 41:39.389
<i>there's always gonna be some
asshole trying to drag him down.</i>

41:40.665 --> 41:42.893
<i>Within months, we doubled in size,</i>

41:42.917 --> 41:44.735
<i>moved to even bigger offices.</i>

41:52.051 --> 41:53.403
<i>It was a madhouse.</i>

41:53.761 --> 41:55.033
<i>A greed-fest,</i>

41:55.054 --> 41:59.034
<i>with equal parts cocaine,
testosterone, and body fluids.</i>

41:59.392 --> 42:00.618
Yes!

42:01.394 --> 42:05.230
<i>It got so bad, I had to declare
the office a fuck-free zone</i>

42:05.231 --> 42:07.208
<i>between the hours of 9:00 and 7:00.</i>

42:07.233 --> 42:09.943
<i>But I'm telling you,
even that didn't help.</i>

42:09.944 --> 42:13.113
<i>Actually, the madness started
on our very first day,</i>

42:13.114 --> 42:14.656
<i>when one of our
brokers, Ben Jenner,</i>

42:14.657 --> 42:16.867
<i>christened the elevator
by getting a blowjob</i>

42:16.868 --> 42:18.452
<i>from a sales assistant.</i>

42:18.453 --> 42:20.454
<i>Her name was Pam,
and to her credit,</i>

42:20.455 --> 42:22.789
<i>she did have this
amazing technique,</i>

42:22.790 --> 42:25.564
<i>with this wild twist
and jerk motion.</i>

42:25.668 --> 42:27.085
<i>About a month later,</i>

42:27.086 --> 42:29.087
<i>Donnie and I decided
to double-team her</i>

42:29.088 --> 42:30.338
<i>on a Saturday afternoon</i>

42:30.339 --> 42:33.192
<i>while our wives were out shopping
for Christmas dresses.</i>

42:33.468 --> 42:34.843
<i>Eventually, Ben married her,</i>

42:34.844 --> 42:37.387
<i>which was pretty amazing
considering she blew</i>

42:37.388 --> 42:39.786
<i>every single guy in the office.</i>

42:39.932 --> 42:43.127
<i>Then he got depressed and killed
himself three years later.</i>

42:43.269 --> 42:47.647
<i>Anyway, I hired my dad, Max,
to maintain order as the Enforcer.</i>

42:47.648 --> 42:49.750
<i>Stratton's very own Gestapo.</i>

42:51.152 --> 42:54.279
<i>We called him Mad Max
because of his hair-trigger temper,</i>

42:54.280 --> 42:55.739
<i>which could be set off by something</i>

42:55.740 --> 42:57.741
<i>as innocuous as a
ringing telephone.</i>

42:59.368 --> 43:02.079
Who the fuck has the goddamn gall

43:02.080 --> 43:04.808
to call this house
on a Tuesday night?

43:04.957 --> 43:07.042
God damn it!

43:07.043 --> 43:08.168
You're gonna miss it!

43:08.169 --> 43:10.087
Ooh, please, tell me
something I don't know.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.923
I wait all week for
the fucking <i>Equalizer</i>

43:12.924 --> 43:15.300
and they have to fucking... Hello.

43:15.301 --> 43:17.094
<i>But as soon as
he picked up the phone...</i>

43:17.095 --> 43:18.492
Gene. How are you, Gene?

43:18.513 --> 43:20.514
<i>he'd affect this weird
British accent.</i>

43:20.515 --> 43:22.367
Right-o, Gene, that'd be great.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.101
Cheerio.

43:24.102 --> 43:25.185
<i>It was absolutely bizarre.</i>

43:25.186 --> 43:26.853
The fucking halfwit!

43:26.854 --> 43:27.979
<i>- He'd hang up...</i>
- You missed it!

43:27.980 --> 43:30.003
<i>and then he's Mad
Max all over again.</i>

43:30.358 --> 43:31.459
Damn it!

43:31.484 --> 43:33.382
All right, tell me what happened.
What happened?

43:33.820 --> 43:35.946
Well, he discovered it
was the mother's sister.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.447
Who's he? Who? Tell me who...

43:37.448 --> 43:39.116
The main guy.
You know who the main...

43:39.117 --> 43:40.283
The main guy...

43:40.284 --> 43:42.728
it was his mother's sister.
She showed up dead.

43:44.038 --> 43:45.705
<i>Of course, Mad
Max didn't have to know</i>

43:45.706 --> 43:47.524
<i>everything we were
doing at Stratton.</i>

43:47.625 --> 43:49.648
And then there's a
big target and we...

43:49.752 --> 43:51.650
They get launched at the target.
They stick.

43:51.712 --> 43:53.880
<i>There's a bull's-eye
and the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.</i>

43:53.881 --> 43:55.048
<i>Whoever gets closer
to the dollar sign...</i>

43:55.049 --> 43:56.091
gets the most points.

43:56.092 --> 43:58.385
I'm gonna throw the shit out
of this little fucking thing.

43:58.386 --> 44:00.387
So if it gets hurt, what happens?

44:00.388 --> 44:01.721
'Cause we're gonna
get fucking nuts.

44:01.722 --> 44:03.056
I don't think he's gonna get hurt.
They're like...

44:03.057 --> 44:04.933
They got like superhuman strength.

44:04.934 --> 44:06.226
I think he's gonna be fine.

44:06.227 --> 44:08.228
You can't look him
right in the eyes.

44:08.229 --> 44:09.479
You can't look him in the eye?

44:09.480 --> 44:11.253
That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.

44:11.315 --> 44:13.191
They get confused
and their wires get crossed.

44:13.192 --> 44:14.818
You gotta look at their chin.

44:14.819 --> 44:15.944
Like it looks like
I'm looking at you

44:15.945 --> 44:17.028
but I'm looking at your chin.

44:17.029 --> 44:19.239
I feel like you're addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

44:19.240 --> 44:21.241
They're like <i>the Mona Lisa.</i>
They find eye contact,

44:21.242 --> 44:22.889
like, wherever you are
standing in the room.

44:22.952 --> 44:24.178
And they lock in.

44:24.287 --> 44:26.687
No, but there is a limit
to what we can do with them?

44:26.956 --> 44:28.081
We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.

44:28.082 --> 44:29.583
We're allowed to
throw food? Bananas.

44:29.584 --> 44:31.084
Any food. Correct.

44:31.085 --> 44:32.252
But, for example,
what I wouldn't do is

44:32.253 --> 44:34.087
maybe like tell him
to pull his cock out

44:34.088 --> 44:35.861
and like get some of the girls to,
you know,

44:35.923 --> 44:37.048
fondle him and shit like that.

44:37.049 --> 44:38.133
That would be...
That's unacceptable?

44:38.134 --> 44:39.217
Let's keep that in our back pocket.

44:39.218 --> 44:41.303
This guy is more about
throwing at the dartboard.

44:41.304 --> 44:42.405
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

44:42.430 --> 44:43.847
The thing is, this
is their gift, okay.

44:43.848 --> 44:45.974
They're built to be thrown
like a lawn dart.

44:45.975 --> 44:47.267
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.

44:47.268 --> 44:48.351
So they're built for accuracy.

44:48.352 --> 44:50.375
Oh, my God. Can we
bowl with this guy?

44:50.438 --> 44:51.563
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

44:51.564 --> 44:52.981
His brother's the bowling ball.

44:52.982 --> 44:54.774
The brother,
you put a skateboard on him,

44:54.775 --> 44:56.109
you strap him to a skateboard,

44:56.110 --> 44:57.611
you toss him down an
alley at some pins.

44:57.612 --> 44:59.321
- No shit. That's interesting.
- Swear to fucking God.

44:59.322 --> 45:01.406
- Can we get that guy?
- Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

45:01.407 --> 45:03.575
But it says here this guy
will show his cock. Yeah.

45:03.576 --> 45:04.910
- Instead of growing up. Yeah.
- He will?

45:04.911 --> 45:06.286
They are very ornery by the way,

45:06.287 --> 45:07.787
so you gotta be very careful
with these little guys.

45:07.788 --> 45:08.872
Safety first.

45:08.873 --> 45:10.040
Safety is first, all right?

45:10.041 --> 45:11.958
I want somebody with
a fucking tranquilizer gun

45:11.959 --> 45:13.710
ready to knock this fucker out.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.962
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace. Taser guns.

45:15.963 --> 45:17.047
A pellet gun maybe?

45:17.048 --> 45:18.256
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

45:18.257 --> 45:19.737
I just want him out.
Knocked out cold.

45:19.759 --> 45:22.362
But I say we stick with
the loophole. Right? Okay?

45:22.511 --> 45:24.304
If we don't consider him a human,

45:24.305 --> 45:26.556
we just consider it an act,
I think we're in the clear.

45:26.557 --> 45:27.682
Like The Flying Wallendas.

45:27.683 --> 45:29.726
You know, a lot of those guys died
but they never sued anybody.

45:29.727 --> 45:31.561
The important thing
you guys gotta keep in mind

45:31.562 --> 45:33.505
is that these things gossip.

45:33.522 --> 45:35.148
They get together and they gossip.

45:35.149 --> 45:36.650
- That's a good point.
- And the last thing

45:36.651 --> 45:38.902
that we need is them
getting together and saying,

45:38.903 --> 45:40.570
"Oh, they made fun of us."

45:40.571 --> 45:42.239
Like, it's gonna make
Stratton look bad.

45:42.240 --> 45:44.407
That's why I love you.
You think of shit like that.

45:44.408 --> 45:47.512
When they come in, we treat
it just like one of us. Okay?

45:47.662 --> 45:50.891
One of us.
Gooble gobble, one of us.

45:50.915 --> 45:52.562
We accept them, one of us!

45:52.625 --> 45:54.352
Gooble gobble, one of us.

45:54.377 --> 45:55.752
We accept them, one of us.

45:55.753 --> 45:56.878
Gooble gobble, one of us!

45:56.879 --> 45:58.255
Jordan! Your dad's coming.

45:58.256 --> 45:59.824
Something about the
American Express bill.

45:59.882 --> 46:01.074
Can you get him out of here?

46:01.092 --> 46:02.284
Yeah. Lick my twat.

46:02.343 --> 46:03.615
No, I'm serious!

46:04.262 --> 46:06.054
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.

46:06.055 --> 46:07.623
You got any fucking stock forms?

46:07.974 --> 46:09.224
He's coming, he's coming.

46:09.225 --> 46:10.451
Make some shit up.

46:10.935 --> 46:12.582
I think if we short Pfizer...

46:12.937 --> 46:17.588
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?

46:17.692 --> 46:22.988
Four hundred and fucking 30,000
fucking dollars in one fucking month!

46:22.989 --> 46:25.198
Good morning.
They're business expenses. Relax.

46:25.199 --> 46:26.533
- Business expenses?
- Yes.

46:26.534 --> 46:28.034
- Jordy, look what you got here.
- What?

46:28.035 --> 46:31.981
Look at this. $26,000
for one fucking dinner!

46:32.039 --> 46:33.812
Okay. No, no.
This could be explained.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.319
Dad, we had clients.
The Pfizer clients.

46:36.502 --> 46:38.253
Right. The porterhouse
from Argentina.

46:38.254 --> 46:40.547
Expensive champagne and...
We had to buy champagne.

46:40.548 --> 46:42.150
And you ordered all
the fucking sides.

46:42.174 --> 46:44.217
- Tell him about the sides.
- I ordered sides, so...

46:44.218 --> 46:47.788
Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?

46:48.097 --> 46:50.165
What are these sides?
They cure cancer?

46:50.266 --> 46:52.142
The sides did cure cancer.
That's the problem.

46:52.143 --> 46:53.665
That's why they were expensive.

46:53.978 --> 46:55.671
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm serious.

46:55.730 --> 46:57.731
- Stop.
- And EJ Entertainment?

46:57.732 --> 46:59.505
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?

47:00.735 --> 47:02.402
Well, that's, uh...

47:02.403 --> 47:03.611
Yeah, Jordy,
what's EJ Entertainment?

47:03.612 --> 47:04.738
How do I describe this?

47:04.739 --> 47:05.864
Jord, what is that?

47:05.865 --> 47:08.059
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.

47:08.075 --> 47:10.177
- That's what it is!
- That is what it is.

47:10.244 --> 47:12.287
Isn't that the perfect
description for it?

47:12.288 --> 47:14.956
That is what it is. But none
of these were charged to me.

47:14.957 --> 47:16.354
This is all of them.

47:16.417 --> 47:18.251
- Oh, that was all us?
- It wasn't me though.

47:18.252 --> 47:20.195
Fucking explain this shit to him!

47:20.254 --> 47:22.732
These are all of your
fucking charges right here!

47:22.965 --> 47:25.425
The IRS, they allow
for T&A. It's fine.

47:25.426 --> 47:26.718
T&E!

47:26.719 --> 47:27.866
T&E!

47:27.887 --> 47:29.012
Yeah. I said T&E.

47:29.013 --> 47:30.388
- No, no. You said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

47:30.389 --> 47:31.473
Yeah, you did.

47:31.474 --> 47:33.850
- When did I say that?
- You said T&A. It's T&E.

47:33.851 --> 47:35.226
I know you're upset
about the dinner,

47:35.227 --> 47:39.606
and that makes sense because we did
spend too much money. But I said T&E.

47:39.607 --> 47:41.316
Don't tell me what you said.
I heard what you said.

47:41.317 --> 47:42.692
- Dad. He said T&A.
- He did?

47:42.693 --> 47:44.110
Absolutely, no question.

47:44.111 --> 47:45.362
I'm trying to...

47:45.363 --> 47:46.488
I'm getting this close!

47:46.489 --> 47:47.781
- Dad, relax.
- I'm getting this close.

47:47.782 --> 47:50.325
That's what I'm saying.
I want you to open up more, Max.

47:50.326 --> 47:51.451
He's gonna fucking kill you.

47:51.452 --> 47:53.099
Why do you hold it in?
Why do you...

47:53.120 --> 47:54.871
Max, why do you hold it in?

47:54.872 --> 47:56.690
That's it. Get the
fuck out of here!

47:56.707 --> 47:59.105
- No, no, no!
- Asshole, get out of here.

47:59.335 --> 48:01.233
What kind of hooker
takes credit cards?

48:01.253 --> 48:02.379
A rich one.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.798
<i>At Stratton,
there were three kinds of hookers.</i>

48:04.799 --> 48:07.175
<i>The Blue Chips, top of the line,
model material.</i>

48:07.176 --> 48:08.760
<i>They cost between $300 and $500</i>

48:08.761 --> 48:10.136
<i>and you had to wear a condom</i>

48:10.137 --> 48:11.638
<i>unless you gave them a hefty tip,</i>

48:11.639 --> 48:13.582
<i>which, of course, I always did.</i>

48:13.641 --> 48:17.310
<i>Then came the NASDAQs,
who were pretty, not great.</i>

48:17.311 --> 48:19.729
<i>They cost between
200 and 300 bucks.</i>

48:19.730 --> 48:22.299
<i>Finally, there were the
Pink Sheets. Skanks.</i>

48:22.316 --> 48:25.276
<i>They cost about 100 or less.
If you didn't wear a condom,</i>

48:25.277 --> 48:26.611
<i>you'd have to get a penicillin shot</i>

48:26.612 --> 48:29.072
<i>the next day
and pray your dick didn't fall off.</i>

48:29.073 --> 48:31.016
<i>Not that we didn't fuck them, too.</i>

48:31.200 --> 48:32.927
<i>Believe me, we did.</i>

48:33.744 --> 48:35.767
Ow! It's that slipped
disc thing again.

48:36.497 --> 48:38.315
I know what it is.
You know, too much...

48:38.624 --> 48:40.125
with EJ Entertainment.

48:40.126 --> 48:41.209
Pops.

48:41.210 --> 48:42.653
How are things at home?

48:42.711 --> 48:44.313
Well, not the best.

48:44.588 --> 48:46.941
She just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?

48:47.299 --> 48:48.508
It's like the smell...

48:48.509 --> 48:50.202
There's a smell,
there's an attraction thing.

48:50.219 --> 48:52.846
After a while it kind of fades away
a little bit.

48:52.847 --> 48:54.597
Yeah, well. It's
supposed to fade away.

48:54.598 --> 48:56.621
- Supposed to?
- That's marriage. You know...

48:56.642 --> 48:59.336
Your mother and I, we've been
married a long, long time.

48:59.353 --> 49:00.562
What do you think? We're, we're...

49:00.563 --> 49:02.506
We're jumping into bed
every two minutes?

49:02.523 --> 49:03.966
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death.

49:04.108 --> 49:06.210
I want to stay married, Dad, but...

49:06.527 --> 49:07.610
It's crazy out there.

49:07.611 --> 49:09.195
Some of these girls...
You should see them.

49:09.196 --> 49:10.548
Oh, my God!

49:11.031 --> 49:12.198
They're fucking...

49:12.199 --> 49:14.200
The things they're doing now, Pops.

49:14.201 --> 49:16.645
I mean... I mean, it's
on a whole other level.

49:16.662 --> 49:18.309
- Really?
- And they're all shaved, too.

49:18.330 --> 49:19.852
- Get out of here!
- All shaven.

49:19.915 --> 49:21.312
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

49:21.333 --> 49:23.652
- Bald as a china doll.
- No bush?

49:23.711 --> 49:25.734
- No bush.
- Oh, my God!

49:25.754 --> 49:29.424
All of a sudden, one week, nobody
had anything down there anymore.

49:29.425 --> 49:30.508
It's a new world.

49:30.509 --> 49:32.552
They're bald from
the eyebrows down.

49:32.553 --> 49:35.156
- Wow.
- Nothing. Not a stitch. It's like lasers.

49:35.264 --> 49:36.581
Wow. A new world.

49:37.099 --> 49:39.702
I was born too... Too early.

49:39.810 --> 49:42.004
I've never been a fan of the bush,
to be honest.

49:42.188 --> 49:43.396
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:43.397 --> 49:44.589
I don't mind it.

49:44.857 --> 49:45.958
Dad.

49:46.525 --> 49:48.502
I don't want you stressing out
about any of this.

49:48.611 --> 49:49.861
How can I not get stressed out?

49:49.862 --> 49:51.321
Look at the knuckleheads
you got working for you.

49:51.322 --> 49:52.572
I know they're knuckleheads

49:52.573 --> 49:54.926
but I need them to want to
live like me, you get it?

49:55.117 --> 49:56.343
To live like me.

49:56.660 --> 49:57.807
Jordy.

49:57.828 --> 50:01.649
One of these days, the chickens are
gonna come home to roost.

50:03.751 --> 50:05.478
You're looking at
me like I'm crazy.

50:05.753 --> 50:08.948
Crazy? This is obscene.

50:09.173 --> 50:10.525
<i>It was obscene.</i>

50:10.758 --> 50:12.280
<i>In the normal world.</i>

50:12.510 --> 50:14.783
<i>But who the fuck
wanted to live there?</i>

50:15.596 --> 50:18.620
<i>Go party your fucking cocks off!</i>

50:21.268 --> 50:25.544
<i>We are about to
become fucking legends</i>

50:25.606 --> 50:27.549
<i>on Wall Street!</i>

50:27.942 --> 50:32.111
<i>We got plans up here
that's gonna take this company</i>

50:32.112 --> 50:35.182
<i>into the fucking stratosphere!</i>

50:38.285 --> 50:39.887
Wolfie! Wolfie!

50:43.916 --> 50:45.734
Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.

50:45.793 --> 50:48.294
Why should they be taking all our
fucking money all the fucking time?

50:48.295 --> 50:49.587
This way we become
the underwriters.

50:49.588 --> 50:51.214
<i>It was our next big move.</i>

50:51.215 --> 50:54.884
<i>Finding companies to
take public. IPOs.</i>

50:54.885 --> 50:56.761
<i>It was the only way
these Wall Street pricks</i>

50:56.762 --> 51:00.557
<i>would ever stop thinking of us
as some shitkicker bucket shop.</i>

51:00.558 --> 51:01.875
We got Arncliffe International.

51:01.934 --> 51:03.476
<i>See, we were a little different.</i>

51:03.477 --> 51:07.146
<i>We liked to get as fucked up as
possible during our business powwows</i>

51:07.147 --> 51:09.691
<i>in order to stimulate
our free-flowing ideas,</i>

51:09.692 --> 51:12.796
<i>which is why we were popping
these ludes like they were M&M's.</i>

51:13.404 --> 51:14.926
Steve Madden.

51:16.365 --> 51:17.615
We own the fucking companies...

51:17.616 --> 51:19.492
We own the companies...

51:19.493 --> 51:21.516
<i>Don't know what
a lude is? I'll tell you.</i>

51:21.579 --> 51:23.602
<i>Oh. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

51:23.664 --> 51:28.440
<i>Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie right now.</i>

52:01.619 --> 52:03.244
The Quaalude,

52:03.245 --> 52:06.205
<i>or lude, as it is
commonly referred to,</i>

52:06.206 --> 52:08.833
<i>was first synthesized in 1951</i>

52:08.834 --> 52:11.586
<i>by an Indian doctor,
that's dots, not feathers,</i>

52:11.587 --> 52:13.087
<i>as a sedative,</i>

52:13.088 --> 52:17.034
<i>and was prescribed to stressed-out
housewives with sleep disorders.</i>

52:17.551 --> 52:19.886
<i>But pretty soon someone figured out</i>

52:19.887 --> 52:23.723
<i>that if you resisted the urge
to sleep for just 15 minutes,</i>

52:23.724 --> 52:26.202
<i>you got a pretty
kick-ass high from it.</i>

52:26.477 --> 52:30.172
<i>Didn't take long for people to
start abusing ludes, of course.</i>

52:30.189 --> 52:33.463
<i>And in 1982, the U-S.
government Schedule 1'd them.</i>

52:33.567 --> 52:35.669
<i>Along with the rest of the world.</i>

52:35.903 --> 52:39.098
<i>Which meant there was only a finite
amount of these things left.</i>

52:39.281 --> 52:42.134
<i>No shit,
you can't even buy 'em anymore.</i>

52:42.409 --> 52:44.682
<i>You people are all
shit out of luck.</i>

52:44.745 --> 52:46.287
What are you saying? What is it?

52:46.288 --> 52:47.560
Steve Madden.

52:47.581 --> 52:49.558
Steve Madden.

52:49.708 --> 52:50.934
Steve.

52:50.959 --> 52:52.185
Steve.

52:52.378 --> 52:53.920
<i>You remember those ads?</i>

52:53.921 --> 52:56.381
<i>Those giant-headed girls
with the bug eyes</i>

52:56.382 --> 52:58.109
<i>wearing those big clunky shoes?</i>

52:58.801 --> 53:00.385
My friend from school,
Steve Madden.

53:00.386 --> 53:01.844
His friend from
school, Steve Madden.

53:01.845 --> 53:04.722
<i>Steve Madden was the name in
women's shoes at the moment.</i>

53:04.723 --> 53:08.518
<i>And all of Wall Street was
begging to take his company public.</i>

53:08.519 --> 53:09.852
Go ahead, go ahead, what is it?

53:09.853 --> 53:11.229
<i>Except, guess who grew up with him?</i>

53:11.230 --> 53:13.106
- Women's shoes.
- Women's shoes.

53:13.107 --> 53:15.756
<i>My very own Vice President.</i>

53:16.110 --> 53:17.652
Women's shoes!

53:17.653 --> 53:19.551
<i>Diamond Donnie Azoff.</i>

53:20.489 --> 53:22.240
- Steve Madden.
- Steve.

53:22.241 --> 53:23.658
Steve.

53:23.659 --> 53:24.784
Hey, JB, JB, JB, JB.

53:24.785 --> 53:26.057
You gotta come check
this fucking chick out.

53:26.078 --> 53:27.930
Look at this. Look.

53:32.960 --> 53:35.878
I would fuck that girl
if she was my sister.

53:35.879 --> 53:38.402
I would let that girl
give me fucking AIDS.

53:38.966 --> 53:40.739
You want to see
the Wolf handle this?

53:43.095 --> 53:44.697
She's hot.

53:45.013 --> 53:46.535
Cristy.

53:51.562 --> 53:53.505
Jordan, this is my friend Naomi.

53:53.522 --> 53:56.149
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Naomi.

53:56.150 --> 53:57.752
Naomi, nice to meet you.

53:57.818 --> 53:59.636
You got an awesome place here.

53:59.820 --> 54:01.988
I've don't think I've ever been
in a house this big before.

54:01.989 --> 54:03.261
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

54:03.365 --> 54:04.591
Beautiful beach out there.

54:04.616 --> 54:05.842
Blair Hollingsworth.

54:06.785 --> 54:08.102
Hi, Blair. Nice to meet you.

54:08.412 --> 54:09.855
- Your name's Blair, right?
- Yeah.

54:09.913 --> 54:11.230
You like to Jet Ski?

54:11.623 --> 54:12.874
I've never done it before.

54:12.875 --> 54:13.958
You've never
Jet Ski'd in your life?

54:13.959 --> 54:15.001
No, I've never Jet Ski'd.

54:15.002 --> 54:16.544
You've never been on a Jet Ski?

54:16.545 --> 54:17.795
How many times are
you gonna ask her?

54:17.796 --> 54:19.273
She's never been on a Jet Ski.

54:19.673 --> 54:21.946
I don't know.
Might ask her a couple more times.

54:22.176 --> 54:24.620
Okay. Sure.

54:25.179 --> 54:27.555
Hi. I'm Hildy. Nice to meet you.

54:27.556 --> 54:29.624
- Hi.
- Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

54:29.767 --> 54:31.119
Yeah, I'll be out in
a couple of minutes.

54:31.143 --> 54:32.518
Just tell her I'll be out
in a couple of minutes.

54:32.519 --> 54:34.061
Why don't you tell your wife that?

54:34.062 --> 54:35.146
I might do that, but I'm having

54:35.147 --> 54:36.647
- a conversation right now.
- What am I, your secretary?

54:36.648 --> 54:38.691
You know what,
I think we should get going.

54:38.692 --> 54:40.013
Wait, wait. Where you guys going?

54:40.027 --> 54:41.549
We gotta go.
We got two other parties to go to.

54:41.612 --> 54:43.305
- We can stay for a drink.
- Yeah, stay for a drink.

54:43.530 --> 54:45.678
No. We got two other parties
we're supposed to get to.

54:45.699 --> 54:46.866
But we can stay for a drink...

54:46.867 --> 54:48.184
She's

54:48.535 --> 54:50.012
perfect.

54:50.037 --> 54:51.621
- You like champagne?
- I do.

54:51.622 --> 54:52.705
She's perfect.

54:52.706 --> 54:54.207
Donnie, what the
fuck are you doing?

54:54.208 --> 54:55.981
You piece of...

55:03.842 --> 55:06.320
You're gonna have to excuse my friend.
He gets...

55:06.512 --> 55:07.720
Get the fuck out!

55:07.721 --> 55:09.522
Jordan, you gotta fuck her, bro.
She's so hot!

55:09.890 --> 55:10.991
Yeah, Donnie!

55:12.142 --> 55:14.143
Let him fucking finish, Hildy.

55:14.144 --> 55:15.871
That's fucking rude.

55:16.146 --> 55:17.793
Have some fucking manners.

55:21.860 --> 55:23.758
So, Bay Ridge,
that's near Staten Island, right?

55:23.779 --> 55:26.177
Brooklyn, across the
Verrazano Bridge.

55:26.323 --> 55:27.845
<i>Saturday Night Fever</i> territory.

55:27.866 --> 55:29.468
That's right. Guinea Gulch.

55:29.576 --> 55:31.828
We call the Verrazano Bridge
the Guinea Gangplank.

55:31.829 --> 55:32.995
Right.

55:32.996 --> 55:34.723
So I presume you're Italian?

55:34.832 --> 55:35.998
On my dad's side.

55:35.999 --> 55:39.319
I'm also Dutch, German, English.

55:39.628 --> 55:40.900
I'm a mutt.

55:41.088 --> 55:42.405
Yeah. You're a mutt.

55:42.422 --> 55:44.820
Yeah, I still have family
over there though, in London.

55:44.925 --> 55:47.593
My Aunt Emma. She's the best.

55:47.594 --> 55:50.638
Very British, you know.
She's a classy lady.

55:50.639 --> 55:52.056
That explains it then.

55:52.057 --> 55:53.140
Explains what?

55:53.141 --> 55:56.040
It explains you.
I mean, you're a duchess, right?

55:56.061 --> 55:58.209
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

56:01.149 --> 56:02.650
Excuse me.

56:02.651 --> 56:04.719
Could I get a straw, please?

56:05.821 --> 56:07.389
Thank you.

56:10.284 --> 56:13.228
So I was, um, a little surprised

56:13.245 --> 56:15.643
you asked Cristy for my number.

56:16.623 --> 56:17.975
Why is that?

56:19.626 --> 56:21.694
Aren't you married?

56:22.796 --> 56:25.214
Well... Yeah, but what?

56:25.215 --> 56:27.238
Married people can't have friends?

56:29.136 --> 56:31.079
We're gonna be friends?

56:32.139 --> 56:35.243
Yeah. You don't want
to be my friend?

56:39.313 --> 56:41.336
We're not gonna be friends.

56:49.698 --> 56:52.267
And at night I work on my designs.

56:52.534 --> 56:55.036
I have an entire line of lingerie.

56:55.037 --> 56:58.016
You know, camisoles,
bustiers, panties.

56:58.999 --> 57:01.417
<i>She designs women's panties, too?</i>

57:01.418 --> 57:03.236
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

57:13.347 --> 57:16.200
<i>Come on, Jordan, think of a way
to get up to her apartment.</i>

57:21.188 --> 57:23.791
You wanna come up for
some tea or something?

57:25.025 --> 57:26.752
Tea? Yeah.

57:26.902 --> 57:28.736
- Like hot tea?
- Yeah.

57:28.737 --> 57:30.134
Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Yeah.

57:30.197 --> 57:32.516
<i>Tea. Fuck, yeah,
I wanted to come up for tea.</i>

57:32.699 --> 57:35.660
Like Darjeeling or rose hip,
something nice like that?

57:35.661 --> 57:36.702
Sure.

57:36.703 --> 57:37.975
This is Rocky.

57:38.163 --> 57:40.482
Oh, who's this? Say hi, Rocky.

57:40.624 --> 57:41.941
Hi, sweetheart.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.147
Okay.

57:43.710 --> 57:46.313
Why don't you light a fire or
something and I'll be right out.

57:46.838 --> 57:48.736
- Yeah. Fire, here?
- Sure.

57:52.052 --> 57:53.699
I like your painting here.
It's, uh...

58:00.352 --> 58:03.456
<i>God, help me.
How do I fuck this girl?</i>

58:06.900 --> 58:08.067
You all right?

58:08.068 --> 58:10.512
Yeah, yeah.
Just trying to light the fire here.

58:16.284 --> 58:17.702
<i>That's it. That's it,
you're leaving.</i>

58:17.703 --> 58:19.680
<i>Don't get involved.
Go home to your wife.</i>

58:29.548 --> 58:31.424
<i>As you can probably guess,</i>

58:31.425 --> 58:34.119
<i>I fucked her goddamn brains out...</i>

58:34.511 --> 58:35.928
Jesus Lord!

58:38.682 --> 58:40.409
<i>For 11 seconds.</i>

58:51.153 --> 58:52.800
Did you just come?

58:52.821 --> 58:54.844
Oh, yeah, I just came.

58:55.782 --> 58:57.225
Did you? Did you come?

58:57.284 --> 58:58.951
- No.
- No?

58:58.952 --> 59:00.178
Okay.

59:00.203 --> 59:02.397
I'm still hard so
just give me a sec.

59:03.373 --> 59:04.895
Sure.

59:05.125 --> 59:06.852
Come on, baby, come on.

59:09.379 --> 59:11.573
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

59:17.345 --> 59:18.822
Oh, God!

59:18.972 --> 59:20.824
Fuck off, Rocky! Bad dog.

59:20.932 --> 59:22.141
You have a biscuit
or something like that?

59:22.142 --> 59:23.243
It's okay.

59:23.477 --> 59:25.019
- Just keep going.
- Rocky, go play.

59:25.020 --> 59:26.997
Go play, Rocky. Go, go, go, go.

59:29.483 --> 59:30.816
You're crazy.

59:30.817 --> 59:32.151
<i>I couldn't get enough.</i>

59:32.152 --> 59:34.612
<i>I mean, her pussy was
like heroin to me.</i>

59:34.613 --> 59:37.448
<i>And it wasn't just
about the sex, either.</i>

59:37.449 --> 59:39.492
<i>Naomi and I got along.
I mean, we...</i>

59:39.493 --> 59:41.470
<i>We had similar interests and shit.</i>

59:46.708 --> 59:48.435
Ooh. Choo-choo train.

59:48.627 --> 59:49.819
Yeah.

59:56.885 --> 01:00:00.706
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:10.003
Yeah, yeah.
Let's toke it all on there, huh?

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:11.732
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:13.210
Oh, shit!

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:24.954
You!

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:27.081
Get out of the fucking car!

01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:28.499
Jesus Christ.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.149
Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck!

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:34.280
Relax, sweetheart. Relax.

01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:37.049
- Son of a fucking bitch!
- Okay, okay... Geez!

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:38.493
Okay, babe, stop!

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.783
- Please.
- Bitch!

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.180
- What are you doing...
- That whore from the party?

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:44.765
Jesus Christ!

01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:45.891
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:47.268
I thought you were at
the fucking beach!

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:48.712
I didn't know you were here!

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:50.312
That's where you've fucking been?

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:52.064
With that fucking
whore from the party?

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:53.607
I thought you were
at the beach house.

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:55.067
How could you do this to me?

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:57.903
- Sweetie, come on...
- Who the fuck are you, Jordan?

01:00:57.904 --> 01:01:00.781
You're like a completely
different fucking person!

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:04.011
I made a mistake. I don't know
what to tell you, babe. I...

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:05.683
I'm sorry.

01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:08.390
- I'm sorry.
- Is that who... Is that what you want?

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:20.194
Do you love her?

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:27.367
Answer me.

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:51.020
<i>I felt horrible.</i>

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.792
<i>Three days later,
I filed for a divorce</i>

01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:55.895
<i>and moved Naomi into the apartment.</i>

01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:01.383
<i>Say what you will,</i>

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:03.636
<i>but the Duchess did have style.</i>

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:06.889
<i>She brought in a decorator,
feng shui'd the whole place.</i>

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.016
<i>She even hired a gay butler.</i>

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:11.977
<i>This guy was smart,</i>
<i>sophisticated, professional</i>

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:13.705
<i>Really, really great.</i>

01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:15.127
Is that jasmine?

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:18.126
Yes, sir. I tried to stump you
this evening. Very good.

01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:20.069
Very good. Great nose.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.843
<i>Except for that one time.</i>

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.261
Oh, my God!

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:31.439
Oh, hey.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:33.233
Is it Wednesday already?

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:35.501
- Uh...
- Oh, don't stop.

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:36.694
What the fuck!

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:38.780
That is fucked up!

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:40.464
He must have thought we were still

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:42.132
at the Hamptons this weekend,
you know.

01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:43.592
Where were they doing it,
sweetheart? In the bedroom?

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:46.345
They were everywhere. There were
two guys over there on the table.

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:47.680
There were more over here.

01:02:47.681 --> 01:02:49.223
- There were four right here.
- Ugh!

01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:50.975
Are you fucking serious?
Right there?

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:53.852
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, baby, it gets worse.

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:57.962
After they left,
I checked the apartment.

01:02:57.983 --> 01:02:59.130
Right. What?

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:01.336
What is it, babe? What?

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:02.736
<i>Where's my money?</i>

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:03.821
I don't know where your money...

01:03:03.822 --> 01:03:05.906
Where is my fucking money?
Where is it?

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:07.950
I don't know where your money is,
Mr. Belfort.

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:10.286
- I didn't do anything.
- If you don't get...

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:11.662
He's lying through
his fucking teeth.

01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:12.913
Let's start from the beginning.

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:14.206
Let's start from the
beginning, all right?

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:15.900
You invited some
friends over, right?

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:17.835
One thing led to another.
Things got out of hand.

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:19.378
We understand that, we do.

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:21.922
We do blow all the time. We're
fucking degenerates ourselves.

01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:23.090
Look at us, right?

01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:24.758
But money was stolen
from my apartment.

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:26.385
Right from my sock drawer.
All right?

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:28.595
Like I said,
I don't know where your money is.

01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:30.055
Just start from the beginning.
Who came over?

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:31.181
It was just a normal day.

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:32.558
I knew you were coming home
the next day.

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:34.935
So everything would be fine.
It'd be cleaned up.

01:03:34.936 --> 01:03:36.895
I got a little high at breakfast.

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:38.814
So I got a little happy.
I had some eggs,

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:39.898
I had a little bit of ice cream.

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:41.817
And then I said, "Who do I
know that likes ice cream?"

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.360
It's my friend, Rudy.
So I called Rudy.

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:45.930
- Who's Rudy?
- Yeah, who's Rudy?

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:50.743
- You know who Rudy is. Come on.
- Me? I don't...

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:51.994
- You know...
- Who the fuck is Rudy?

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:53.120
I don't know anyone named Rudy.

01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:54.246
Last month. The Lollipop Club.

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:55.831
You know who Rudy was. Dancing...

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:57.980
You know who Rudy is?

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.419
I don't fucking know any...

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.462
What do you mean?

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:02.629
So he went to The Lollipop Club?

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:04.298
Oh, he was
at The Lollipop Club for sure.

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:05.924
On the stage, grinding
with everybody.

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:07.572
I got fucked up. I like to dance.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:09.595
I don't know.
Maybe I met him, maybe I didn't.

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:11.323
I meet a lot of fucking people.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.098
- What are you saying?
- $50,000 was stolen

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:14.433
from my fucking sock drawer!

01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:16.018
All my girlfriend's
jewelry is gone.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.020
- Where the fuck is it?
- ...Rudy. What the fuck?

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:20.147
Did your fucking little faggot
friend Rudy take my shit?

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:21.921
Did he? Answer me!

01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:24.506
Okay. Now I get it.
Now I get why I'm...

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:25.758
- This is a gay thing.
- Oh!

01:04:25.904 --> 01:04:27.696
See, all of you...

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.217
You think this is
'cause you're a fag?

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:31.200
My cousin's a fucking faggot.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.619
And I go on vacation with him
and his boyfriend. I love fags.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:34.870
You were in charge, right?

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.622
I will not be stolen from.
You get that?

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.916
I fucking like gay people.
I don't like you.

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:40.292
He should've hired
a fucking Mexican

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:41.645
like I have in my fucking house.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:44.864
Shit! What the fuck...

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:50.427
Talk, you fuck, talk!

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:51.637
I'm gonna drop you, you faggot!

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:53.055
Where is it?

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:56.100
<i>Chester and Toby,
they went all yakuza on Nicholas.</i>

01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:57.267
<i>You know, they got crazy.</i>

01:04:57.268 --> 01:04:58.415
I don't know!

01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:02.127
<i>I had to call the cops just to
keep them from killing the poor guy.</i>

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:03.649
<i>I gave them each 1,000 bucks</i>

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:05.844
<i>and told them what
Nicholas had done.</i>

01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:07.504
<i>Then they kicked his ass.</i>

01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:09.343
Thanks again, Officer.

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:12.324
<i>It's not like I cared about
the 50 grand anyway.</i>

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:13.992
<i>I was making that much
almost every day</i>

01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:16.370
<i>through one rathole or another.</i>

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:19.206
<i>Now a rathole is a
friend, like Brad here,</i>

01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:21.834
<i>who held stock in his name for me.</i>

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:24.169
Who are you supposed to be, huh?
Jack Nickle-Jew?

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:26.797
<i>I'd drive the price up
then he'd sell</i>

01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:29.007
<i>and kick most of the
profits back to...</i>

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:30.985
<i>You guessed it, me.</i>

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:36.265
<i>All cash. None of
it's on the books.</i>

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:38.619
<i>A big no-no, of course,
in the eyes of the law.</i>

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:42.672
<i>Enter our new securities attorney,
Manny Riskin.</i>

01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:46.400
<i>700 bucks an hour
to be the voice of doom.</i>

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:48.193
Listen to me.
You piss up the SEC's leg,

01:05:48.194 --> 01:05:49.528
you end up with your
tits in a ringer.

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:52.633
Do not worry about it.
I have the SEC under control.

01:05:52.907 --> 01:05:55.476
What the fuck
are these imbeciles doing?

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:56.910
Hey! Hey!

01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:58.370
What are you doing? Hey!

01:05:58.371 --> 01:05:59.814
We got the SEC in here.

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.499
<i>The Securities
and Exchange Commission</i>

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.169
<i>sent two lawyers down
to review our files.</i>

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.171
<i>So I set them up in
our conference room</i>

01:06:07.172 --> 01:06:08.338
<i>and I had it bugged</i>

01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:10.632
<i>and the air conditioning
turned up so high</i>

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:12.217
<i>that it felt like
Antarctica in there.</i>

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:14.303
Is it always this cold in here?

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:15.387
I don't know.

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:16.680
<i>Then, while they were looking</i>

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:18.182
<i>for a smoking gun in that room...</i>

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:20.081
Arncliffe International is on fire.

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:23.395
<i>I was gonna fire off
a bazooka in here,</i>

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:25.731
<i>offering up our latest IPO.</i>

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:28.317
An IPO is an initial
public offering.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:32.154
It's the first time a stock is offered
for sale to the general population.

01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:34.072
Now, as the firm taking
the company public,

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:35.866
we set the initial sales price

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:38.686
then sold those shares
right back to our friends. The...

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:40.412
Look.

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:42.390
I know you're not following
what I'm saying anyway, right?

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:44.416
That's okay. That doesn't matter.

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:46.335
The real question is this.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.295
"Was all this legal?"

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:50.273
Absolutely fucking not.

01:06:50.548 --> 01:06:53.026
But we were making more money
than we knew what to do with.

01:06:57.472 --> 01:06:58.555
<i>And what do you do
when you're making</i>

01:06:58.556 --> 01:07:00.329
<i>more money than you
know what to do with?</i>

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.544
Oh, my God!

01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:09.542
Will you marry me?

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:11.443
Oh, my God.

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:13.546
Is that a yes?

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:15.280
Are you sure?

01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:17.258
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.018
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:33.199
<i>I held my bachelor party
at the Mirage in Las Vegas.</i>

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:35.652
<i>The flight there alone
was a bacchanal.</i>

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.803
<i>One last blowout for the gods</i>

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:39.872
<i>before I settled down for good.</i>

01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:41.640
<i>A hundred Strattonites,</i>

01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:44.585
<i>50 hookers, plus 50 more
waiting once we landed.</i>

01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:46.270
<i>Oh, and the drugs.</i>

01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:50.217
<i>I mean, I tell you, our plane was
like a pharmacy with wings.</i>

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:22.957
<i>All told, the weekend
cost me 2 million bucks,</i>

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:28.078
<i>including the cost of refurbishing
the entire 28th floor.</i>

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:30.479
kiss the bride.

01:08:32.483 --> 01:08:33.817
<i>Ah! But the wedding</i>

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:36.046
<i>was something out of a fairy tale.</i>

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:39.197
<i>With Naomi, my Duchess,</i>

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:40.782
<i>me, her handsome Duke,</i>

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:43.932
<i>and The Bahamas Ocean Club,
our castle.</i>

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:57.633
<i>Of course, after the bachelor
party, me, the Duke,</i>

01:08:57.634 --> 01:09:00.469
<i>needed a few penicillin shots
so he could</i>

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.698
<i>safely consummate the marriage.</i>

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.828
Hey! Barry Kleinman,
filming the wedding.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.376
A few words for your son?

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:14.107
Jordan. Remember what I told you.

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:17.319
It involves your penis
and her vagina.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:20.390
And you know,
you know what you can do, Jordy.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:39.174
Oh, my God!

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.652
Aunt Emma?

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.741
I can't believe you came!

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:50.415
Jordan! Jordan! Look who came!

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:52.205
It's Aunt Emma.

01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:54.419
Aunt Emma.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.884
- Oh, Jordan, dear, how lovely.
- Hey, how you doing?

01:09:57.652 --> 01:10:00.426
It's a pleasure to finally meet you
in person.

01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:02.406
Into the donuts, I see.

01:10:02.407 --> 01:10:04.783
Oh, I... I...

01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:05.885
Well...

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:09.246
I lived through the '60s, my dear.

01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:10.815
Enjoy the day.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.313
She surprised me.
I didn't even know.

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:29.141
Just one more step. Are you ready?

01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:30.809
- Where are we going?
- Keep your eyes closed.

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:32.253
One, two, three!

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:35.748
What is this?

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:36.982
It's your wedding present.

01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:38.108
What?

01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:40.428
It's your wedding present,
sweetheart.

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:42.214
What?

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:44.781
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:45.929
A fucking yacht?

01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:48.994
<i>For millionaires
whose ships have come in,</i>

01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:51.830
<i>pricey pleasure boats
are for the most fun afloat.</i>

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:55.041
<i>It's no coincidence that
its 150 feet of green hull</i>

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:57.294
<i>is the color of cash.
Anchors aweigh!</i>

01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:59.648
Oh, my God! Baby!

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.592
- I think you like it?
- You're crazy.

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:05.115
- You like it?
- Yes!

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:13.560
<i>For three weeks, we sailed
the Naomi through the Caribbean,</i>

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:15.645
<i>eventually taking her home
to Long Island,</i>

01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:16.813
<i>where we bought a house.</i>

01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:19.508
<i>Seven acres on the Gold Coast
of Long Island.</i>

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:22.068
<i>The most expensive real estate
in the world.</i>

01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:24.821
<i>With maids, cooks, landscapers,
you name it.</i>

01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:27.365
<i>We even had two guards
who worked in shifts.</i>

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:28.809
<i>Both named Rocco.</i>

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:34.774
<i>It was heaven on earth.</i>

01:11:37.543 --> 01:11:39.044
Wake up, you piece of shit!

01:11:39.045 --> 01:11:40.879
- Ow!
- Who's Venice?

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.297
- Huh?
"Who?

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:43.381
Who? Who?

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:45.133
"Who?" What are you, a fucking owl?

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:46.426
Who is she?

01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:47.886
Some little hooker you
were fucking last night?

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:49.888
What the fuck are
you talking about? No.

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:51.598
No way, baby, no!

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:53.997
You were calling her
name in your sleep!

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:56.746
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I don't...

01:11:57.188 --> 01:11:58.897
I don't even know who Venice is.

01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:01.233
What the fuck does that even mean?
Venice.

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:04.087
That's the stupidest shit
I've ever heard in my fucking life!

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.059
Venice...

01:12:10.409 --> 01:12:12.637
Venice, baby, where are you?

01:12:13.246 --> 01:12:14.643
Venice!

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:16.850
Venice!

01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:18.583
Where'd you go?

01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:25.423
Oh, baby.
Oh, you're gonna play rough, huh?

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:27.717
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- You like that?

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:32.202
I like it. I like it. Ow.

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:34.057
Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie.

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:35.100
Wolfie?

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:36.643
Yeah, it's my safe word, baby.
It's my safe word.

01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:38.353
I don't give a fuck
about your safe word!

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:40.313
- Come on!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:42.792
- Ahh!
- Shut up, you little bitch!

01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:45.318
You're a fucking
dirty little birdy!

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:46.420
Owie!

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:48.468
That's right.

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:49.865
That's right! I forgot.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.434
I forgot, baby.

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:53.618
Donnie and I were investing

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:55.829
in a condominium complex in Venice.

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:57.038
That's why all this confusion.

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:58.623
Oh, you're investing in Italy?

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:00.458
Not Italy. California.

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:02.043
- Oh, California?
- Yeah.

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:03.253
You're a lying piece of shit!

01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:04.504
Duchess, baby, come on.

01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:06.152
Don't you fucking "Duchess" me.

01:13:06.173 --> 01:13:07.799
Don't you "Duchess" me!

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.904
Do you really think that I
don't know what you're up to?

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:12.888
- You're a father now, Jordan.
- Yeah.

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:14.389
- You're a father now.
- I know...

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.141
And you're still
acting like an infant!

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:18.916
God damn it!

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:21.919
Baby, you know,
you got real anger issues.

01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:24.316
Who is the one who flew in here

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:27.277
at 3:00 in the morning
on their stupid helicopter

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:29.404
and woke up Skylar? That was you!

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:32.133
Oh, Skylar! Oh, fucking bullshit!

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:44.198
<i>Does it even matter to you</i>

01:13:44.211 --> 01:13:46.939
that I just had that driving range

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:50.216
sodded with Bermuda grass, Jordan,

01:13:50.217 --> 01:13:52.135
- and now you fucking wrecked it!
- Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:54.034
No, you didn't research
the whole thing

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.348
and deal with the fucking
golf course people!

01:13:56.349 --> 01:13:57.599
Oh, my God,

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.185
you had to deal
with the golf course people, too!

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:03.005
What a Greek tragedy, honey!
Oh, my God!

01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:05.982
You probably had to pay them
in cash with your hands!

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:07.275
What a fucking burden.

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:09.319
And actually do some work
besides swiping

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.529
my fucking credit
card all day, huh?

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:14.324
Because I can't keep track
of your professions, honey.

01:14:14.325 --> 01:14:16.284
'Cause last month
you were a wine connoisseur.

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.370
Now you're an aspiring
landscape architect!

01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:20.163
- Let me get that right... No!
- Fuck you!

01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:22.248
Don't fucking dare throw that

01:14:22.249 --> 01:14:24.818
fucking water at me.
Don't you fucking dare.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:27.150
All right, honey?

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:28.755
Now will you just...

01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:30.715
We could talk this out, all right?

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:33.160
We just use our words. You know?

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:34.344
Communicate.

01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:35.662
Okay?

01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:37.494
Come on, sweetheart.

01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:39.541
Talk to me. Talk to me.

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:41.685
Stop flexing your muscles, Jordan.

01:14:41.686 --> 01:14:43.478
You look like a fucking imbecile.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:44.562
Babe, come on.

01:14:44.563 --> 01:14:48.108
You should feel happy
you got a husband

01:14:48.109 --> 01:14:50.462
who's in such great
shape like this, huh?

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:52.487
Come here.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:54.072
Come on, give me a kiss.

01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:55.240
You look so beautiful right now.

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:56.449
- Come on.
- Kiss you?

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:57.701
- You look so beautiful...
- Kiss you?

01:14:57.702 --> 01:14:59.429
Yeah, give me one...

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:01.705
Fuck you!

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:03.808
<i>Ah, yes, my morning ritual.</i>

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:06.251
<i>First I'd get up and
fight with Naomi</i>

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.545
<i>about whatever it is I did
the night before.</i>

01:15:08.546 --> 01:15:10.839
<i>Next was a steam so
I could sweat out</i>

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.674
<i>the drugs still in my system.</i>

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.402
<i>Then I'd assess the damage.</i>

01:15:14.552 --> 01:15:16.404
<i>Drown out my eyeballs.</i>

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:19.014
<i>Take my "back pills"
to get the day started,</i>

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.209
<i>then seek to make up with Naomi.</i>

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:23.248
Good morning, Daddy.

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:25.045
Where's my kiss?

01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:27.165
Whee!

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:28.875
Hey, sweetheart.

01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:33.611
Does Daddy get a kiss
from both of his little girls, huh?

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:35.071
Oh, no.

01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:38.241
No, Daddy doesn't even
get to touch Mommy

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:40.094
for a very, very,

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:41.930
very long time.

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:45.206
Daddy's really sorry about what
he said in the other room.

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:46.499
He didn't mean any of it.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.898
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

01:15:49.336 --> 01:15:51.029
And from now on,

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:54.571
it's gonna be nothing but short,

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:57.036
short skirts around the house.

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:02.124
And you know something else, Daddy?

01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:09.215
Mommy is just so sick and
tired of wearing panties.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.923
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:16.759
In fact,

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:21.493
she's decided to throw them

01:16:21.494 --> 01:16:24.768
all away.

01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:32.446
So take a good look, Daddy.

01:16:32.797 --> 01:16:35.924
You're gonna be seeing an awful
lot of this around the house.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.550
Oh, baby...

01:16:37.551 --> 01:16:39.119
Yeah, Mommy.

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:41.535
- Yeah...
- But no touching.

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:43.707
Oh, gosh.

01:16:45.017 --> 01:16:46.414
Ow.

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:49.896
What's wrong, Daddy?

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:51.340
Mmm, baby.

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:54.631
God!

01:16:56.195 --> 01:16:57.467
Look at this shit.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:17:01.351
Okay. Mommy likes to
play games with Daddy.

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:05.684
Mommy, have you ever noticed

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:07.640
anything odd about Mr...

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.733
Mr. Fuzzy Bear over there?

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:15.023
His eyes seem
to be a little bit odd, don't they?

01:17:15.381 --> 01:17:18.967
Yeah, there's something a little
bit different about his eyes.

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:22.220
Yes!
I think it's true. Say "Hi," Mommy.

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:24.180
Say "Hi" to Rocco and Rocco.

01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:25.640
<i>- Say "Hi." Hi, fellas.</i>

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.058
See that, huh?

01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:28.893
<i>Of all the fucking days,</i>

01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:30.792
<i>she chooses today to
give me blue balls!</i>

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:33.940
<i>I mean, today was the biggest day
in Stratton's history,</i>

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:35.859
<i>and I needed to be
thinking straight.</i>

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:37.337
Hey, Jordan!

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:39.529
- Welcome.
- Steve here yet?

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:42.759
<i>This was the day that we
launched the Steve Madden IPO.</i>

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:44.951
Troops are all here,
everyone's all rallied, excited.

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:46.828
<i>Everything had to run tight.</i>

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:47.954
<i>It had to be perfect.</i>

01:17:47.955 --> 01:17:49.648
What the fuck is that kid doing?

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:51.859
What's he doing?

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.478
The biggest IPO in
this firm's history.

01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:56.860
What the fuck is he doing?

01:17:57.756 --> 01:17:59.858
Is he... Is he wearing a bow tie?

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:01.242
Hi.

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:03.428
How're you doing?

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:04.576
Good.

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:07.287
You cleaning the fish bowl?

01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:10.461
I just... I had a minute and...

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:12.246
You had a minute.

01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:14.856
And today you needed to
clean the fish bowl? Today?

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:18.632
I had finished my paperwork
and I had a couple of minutes.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.546
Okay. Nice to meet you.

01:18:26.493 --> 01:18:27.845
On new issue day?

01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:32.062
On cocksucking,
motherfucking new issue day?

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:33.396
This is what you do?

01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:36.357
Hey, everybody, listen up!

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:39.607
This is what happens when you fuck
with your pets on new issue day!

01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:55.130
Take your little bow tie,
get your shit,

01:18:55.356 --> 01:18:57.273
and get the fuck out of my office!
You understand?

01:18:57.274 --> 01:18:58.876
Get the fuck out!

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:04.030
Everybody on point!

01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:07.055
We are here to make money.
Everybody on point.

01:19:09.453 --> 01:19:12.288
<i>A real wolf pit,
which is exactly how I liked it.</i>

01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:14.999
Jordan, look what I caught in
the lobby. I caught a genius.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.568
<i>Enter Steve Madden.</i>

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:17.752
The great American cobbler.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.231
<i>Red-hot ladies footwear Impresario.</i>

01:19:20.673 --> 01:19:23.883
<i>And thanks to Donnie,
we were taking his company public.</i>

01:19:23.884 --> 01:19:27.705
<i>Stratton Oakmont was crawling
out of the primordial ooze.</i>

01:19:27.846 --> 01:19:29.789
<i>Pond scum no more.</i>

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:31.349
That's why they gotta
see your face.

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.935
You get them fired up so they push
the shit out of this stock. Okay?

01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:36.604
<i>And not only that,
Donnie and I secretly owned</i>

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:38.958
<i>85% of Steve Madden Shoes,</i>

01:19:39.483 --> 01:19:41.526
<i>which legally speaking
was a big no-no,</i>

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:45.052
<i>but we'd get filthy fucking rich
if our troops got behind it.</i>

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:47.634
<i>Our job was to get them worked up.</i>

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.598
<i>- But not too worked up.</i>
- Shh.

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:52.809
Hello. If, uh...

01:19:53.247 --> 01:19:55.475
For those of you who don't know me,
uh...

01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:56.833
My name's Steve Madden.

01:19:56.834 --> 01:19:58.668
Yeah, we know who you are.

01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:00.066
Your name is on the box.

01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:01.796
Get the shoes. Show them the shoes.

01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:03.490
- Show them the shoes.
- Okay. Yeah.

01:20:03.674 --> 01:20:06.718
Anyway, you know,
this shoe is pretty cool.

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:09.679
This is the Mary Lou, which is really
the shoe that put me on the map.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.347
Without it, I wouldn't be here.

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:12.598
It's a fat girls' shoe!

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:14.667
Believe it or not...
Believe it or not though,

01:20:14.685 --> 01:20:16.269
the Mary Lou is actually the same

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:18.062
as the Mary Jane, but
it's black leather.

01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:24.402
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:26.301
Fight back! Come on!
Where you at? Where you at?

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:28.906
All right!

01:20:28.907 --> 01:20:32.285
Let's give it up for Steve Madden
and his awesome Mary Lou!

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:34.514
Hold that up. Hold that up.
Hold that up proud!

01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:37.107
Give him a round of applause!

01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:40.436
You guys got that
out of your systems, huh?

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:43.355
You having a good
afternoon or what?

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:46.966
I wanna take a moment
and tell you why Steve here is so

01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:49.365
absolutely off the fucking wall.

01:20:50.471 --> 01:20:52.198
It's because this man

01:20:52.473 --> 01:20:54.166
is a creative genius.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.642
This ability, this gift

01:20:56.643 --> 01:20:58.245
that Steve has,

01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:59.854
it goes beyond just

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:01.606
spotting the hottest shoe trends.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:05.507
Steve's power is that
he creates trends.

01:21:05.736 --> 01:21:06.883
You understand?

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:09.530
Artists like Steve come along
once every decade.

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:13.034
I'm talking Giorgio Armani,
Gianni Versace, Coco Chanel,

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:14.728
Yves Saint Laurent.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.847
Steve, come over here for a second.

01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:19.103
I don't think you all realize

01:21:19.666 --> 01:21:21.143
that Steve Madden

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:24.754
is the hottest person
in the women's shoe industry,

01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:26.130
with orders going through the roof

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:29.576
at every department store
in North America right now.

01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:32.070
We have him here in our office!

01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:35.890
We should thank our fucking
lucky stars this man is here!

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.559
We should be
on our hands and knees right now,

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.728
getting ready to suck this guy off!

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:42.046
Like this! Okay?

01:21:43.524 --> 01:21:45.251
I wanna suck you off, Steve!

01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:47.719
Everyone's gonna suck you off!

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:49.654
This is our golden ticket

01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:51.781
to the fucking chocolate factory
right here!

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.055
And I wanna meet

01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:56.478
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?

01:21:57.037 --> 01:21:59.981
I wanna be with the
fucking Oompa Loompas like this!

01:22:03.961 --> 01:22:06.439
All right, get off this fucking stage!
Get out of here.

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:09.366
All right, I want you all
to focus for a second.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.902
See those little black boxes?

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:13.177
They're called telephones.

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:16.055
I'm gonna let you in on a little
secret about these telephones.

01:22:16.056 --> 01:22:18.750
They're not gonna dial themselves.
Okay?

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:22.588
Without you, they're just
worthless hunks of plastic.

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:26.800
Like a loaded M16 without a trained
Marine to pull the trigger.

01:22:27.734 --> 01:22:30.257
And in the case of the telephone,

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.048
it's up to each and
every one of you,

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:36.644
my highly-trained Strattonites.

01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:39.058
My killers!

01:22:39.705 --> 01:22:43.105
My killers,
who will not take no for an answer!

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:45.569
My fucking warriors,

01:22:45.919 --> 01:22:48.004
who will not hang up the phone

01:22:48.005 --> 01:22:51.048
until their client either buys

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:53.301
or fucking dies!

01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:09.901
Let me tell you something.

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:13.006
There is no nobility in poverty.

01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:16.449
I have been a rich man
and I have been a poor man.

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:18.451
And I choose rich
every fucking time.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.412
Because at least as a rich man,

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:22.872
when I have to face my problems,

01:23:22.873 --> 01:23:24.832
I show up in the back of a limo,

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.751
wearing a $2,000 suit

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:29.480
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

01:23:33.634 --> 01:23:34.800
Duke it out! Hit him!

01:23:34.801 --> 01:23:36.323
Get the fuck off me!

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:40.373
And if anyone here
thinks I'm superficial

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:41.933
or materialistic,

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:44.310
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,

01:23:44.311 --> 01:23:46.459
'cause that's where
you fucking belong!

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.044
But before you depart
this room full of winners,

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:54.070
I want you to take a good look

01:23:54.071 --> 01:23:55.844
at the person next to you. Go on.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:59.218
Because sometime in
the not-so-distant future,

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:00.993
you're gonna be pulling
up to a red light

01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:03.062
in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:06.457
and that person's gonna be
pulling up right alongside you

01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:08.686
in their brand new Porsche

01:24:09.419 --> 01:24:11.504
with their beautiful
wife by their side,

01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:13.047
who's got big voluptuous tits.

01:24:15.133 --> 01:24:17.468
And who're you gonna
be sitting next to?

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:19.303
Some disgusting wildebeest

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:20.888
with three days of razor-stubble,

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:22.306
in a sleeveless muumuu,

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:24.767
crammed in next to you
in a carload full of groceries

01:24:24.768 --> 01:24:26.602
from the fucking Price Club!

01:24:26.603 --> 01:24:28.980
That's who you're gonna
be sitting next to!

01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:31.315
So you listen to me
and you listen well.

01:24:31.316 --> 01:24:33.669
Are you behind on your
credit card bills?

01:24:33.986 --> 01:24:36.259
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:39.221
Is your landlord ready
to evict you? Good!

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:41.659
Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:45.037
Does your girlfriend think
you're a fucking worthless loser?

01:24:45.038 --> 01:24:47.982
Good! Pick up the
phone and start dialing!

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:50.436
I want you to deal
with your problems

01:24:50.502 --> 01:24:51.711
by becoming rich!

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.756
All you have to do today

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:57.279
is pick up that phone

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:00.912
and speak the words
that I have taught you.

01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:03.581
And I will make you richer

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:05.141
than the most powerful CEO

01:25:05.142 --> 01:25:06.726
in the United States
of fucking America!

01:25:06.727 --> 01:25:08.329
Yeah!

01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:10.418
Fuck, yeah!

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:13.133
I want you to go out there

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:15.627
and I want you to ram

01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:19.238
Steve Madden stock
down your clients' throats

01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:21.637
until they fucking choke on it!

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:24.118
Till they choke on it and they buy

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:26.287
100,000 shares! That's what I want.

01:25:26.288 --> 01:25:27.872
Yeah! Fuck, yeah.

01:25:27.873 --> 01:25:29.646
You be ferocious!

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:31.648
- You be relentless!
- Yeah!

01:25:31.668 --> 01:25:35.068
You be telephone
fucking terrorists!

01:25:36.423 --> 01:25:40.051
Now let's knock this motherfucker
out of the park!

01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:15.154
<i>At 1:00 p.m., we opened
the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.</i>

01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:18.361
<i>By 1:03, it was over $18.</i>

01:26:18.382 --> 01:26:20.780
<i>Even the big Wall Street firms
were buying.</i>

01:26:30.602 --> 01:26:32.603
Of the two million shares
offered for sale,

01:26:32.604 --> 01:26:35.606
a million belonged to me, held in
phony accounts by my ratholes.

01:26:35.607 --> 01:26:37.926
Now once the price hit
the high teens...

01:26:37.943 --> 01:26:40.194
You know what? Who gives a shit?

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:41.922
As always, the point is this.

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:46.760
$22 million in three fucking hours!

01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:49.763
Can you believe this shit?

01:26:49.955 --> 01:26:52.248
- I fucking love this, baby!
- It's amazing!

01:26:52.249 --> 01:26:53.475
Jordan!

01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:55.126
Barry Kleinman's on the phone

01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:56.877
- from Future Video.
- Who?

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:58.170
I don't know.
He shot at your wedding.

01:26:58.171 --> 01:26:59.296
He says it's urgent.

01:26:59.297 --> 01:27:01.507
Urgent?
Who the fuck is Barry Kleinman?

01:27:01.508 --> 01:27:03.175
Oh, my God, you wanna marry me?

01:27:03.176 --> 01:27:04.301
You're in love with me?

01:27:04.302 --> 01:27:05.449
Yeah. Go fuck your cousin!

01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:06.554
Hey, Barry, what's up?

01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:08.764
Listen, I got this subpoena.

01:27:08.765 --> 01:27:10.307
<i>Subpoena? What the fuck
are you talking about?</i>

01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:11.892
Yeah, the FBI, they want a copy

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:13.018
of your wedding video.

01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:14.291
<i>The fucking FBI?</i>

01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:16.313
- You fucking kidding me?
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:17.690
<i>His name is Denham.</i>

01:27:17.691 --> 01:27:19.442
<i>He's an agent with
the New York office.</i>

01:27:19.443 --> 01:27:20.568
<i>What's his problem?</i>

01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:23.297
<i>He's a Boy Scout. He thinks
you're fucking Gordon Gekko.</i>

01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:25.823
What does he want
with my wedding video?

01:27:25.824 --> 01:27:27.533
It's like an invasion
of my privacy.

01:27:27.534 --> 01:27:28.977
You know what I'm saying?
It's like...

01:27:28.994 --> 01:27:30.369
It's intrusive, you know.

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:33.122
He's got pictures of your
whole inner fucking circle.

01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:35.040
Pictures, names of the people.

01:27:35.041 --> 01:27:36.125
You know what he's trying to do?

01:27:36.126 --> 01:27:37.334
Exactly what he's doing.
Look at yourself.

01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:38.627
He's trying to rattle you,

01:27:38.628 --> 01:27:40.171
he's trying to rattle
your old lady,

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:43.007
so she nags you
until you become a fucking witness.

01:27:43.008 --> 01:27:44.508
He wants me to rat on myself?

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:46.452
He wants me
to give information about my...

01:27:46.678 --> 01:27:48.345
Listen. The good fucking news is,

01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:50.181
you know I know everybody downtown,

01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:52.516
I call up the Justice Department,
the DEA,

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:55.712
nobody even knows you fucking
exist, so calm down!

01:27:55.896 --> 01:27:57.213
They don't know I exist?

01:27:57.355 --> 01:27:59.128
- No.
- That's good.

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:05.154
But you...

01:28:05.155 --> 01:28:06.723
You know who he is, right?

01:28:07.365 --> 01:28:09.408
- Yeah.
- So, if I just wanted to get

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:11.452
some more information,
just find out what he knows,

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:14.705
you could go to his house, right?

01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:16.707
Tap his phones a
little bit, bug him.

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:17.875
You could get some information...

01:28:17.876 --> 01:28:20.795
You don't fuck with
these guys like that.

01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:21.962
You don't fuck with them like that.

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.214
What are you, nuts or something?

01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:24.924
This is what you fucking do.
What do I pay you for?

01:28:24.925 --> 01:28:28.093
I have a fucking P.I. license, you know?
I make a living at this.

01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:29.220
I'm not a cop anymore.

01:28:29.221 --> 01:28:31.347
They'll take my fucking license
away from me, all right?

01:28:31.348 --> 01:28:32.495
Okay.

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:35.494
Okay, if I can't do that,
can I just...

01:28:35.685 --> 01:28:37.037
Can I give the guy a call?

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:40.231
- Why? Is that...
- Jordan. Jordan.

01:28:40.232 --> 01:28:41.315
Do me a favor?

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:44.318
The only one who calls this guy
is your fucking lawyer.

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:45.402
I can't call him, right?

01:28:45.403 --> 01:28:47.238
- It's against the rules?
- I told you,

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:48.989
whatever the fuck you say to him,

01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:51.700
he's gonna use against you.
Don't you understand?

01:28:51.701 --> 01:28:53.536
He's smart, you're dumb.

01:28:53.537 --> 01:28:54.854
Fucking bullshit.

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:56.664
Are we fucking talking tonight,

01:28:56.665 --> 01:28:57.915
or are you gonna get schwacked?

01:28:57.916 --> 01:28:59.583
The last time you took
these fucking pills,

01:28:59.584 --> 01:29:02.064
you put your head in the fucking
macaroni. I had to pick it up.

01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:04.213
All right.

01:29:04.214 --> 01:29:05.941
Okay, I won't call him.

01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:10.845
Hey, fellas! Come on board.

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:12.698
The plank's right around there.

01:29:13.473 --> 01:29:14.825
Welcome!

01:29:14.933 --> 01:29:16.910
Whoo! What a nice day.

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:20.087
Hey.

01:29:20.438 --> 01:29:21.835
Welcome aboard.

01:29:22.482 --> 01:29:24.233
Jordan. Welcome aboard the <i>Naomi.</i>

01:29:24.234 --> 01:29:25.359
Pleasure to meet you.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.861
Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.

01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:27.987
Hi, how are you?

01:29:27.988 --> 01:29:31.323
Let me introduce you. This is Nicole,
Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy.

01:29:31.324 --> 01:29:33.909
What are you guys all shy for?
Don't be scared.

01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:35.160
These are friends of Stratton.

01:29:35.161 --> 01:29:36.433
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello.

01:29:36.454 --> 01:29:38.727
Um...

01:29:39.332 --> 01:29:42.902
Your message said
that you wanted to speak privately.

01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:44.779
Right. I do want to
speak privately.

01:29:44.796 --> 01:29:46.193
Give us a minute, huh, ladies?

01:29:46.381 --> 01:29:47.798
Let me know if I can
get you anything.

01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:49.151
We'd be happy to help.

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:50.968
You guys hungry?

01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:52.052
Want something to eat?

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:53.888
Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster.

01:29:53.889 --> 01:29:56.307
I got whiskey.
Any kind of booze you want.

01:29:56.308 --> 01:29:57.892
You know what?
The Bureau doesn't allow us

01:29:57.893 --> 01:29:59.461
to drink while we're at sea.

01:29:59.603 --> 01:30:00.704
Duh! Of course.

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:03.957
Ever been on one of these before?

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:05.379
A boat?

01:30:05.984 --> 01:30:07.401
I learned how to
sail when I was six.

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:09.570
No shit. Is that right? Really?

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:11.363
On one like this, though?

01:30:11.364 --> 01:30:14.263
I had the whole front extended in
order to fit the chopper up there.

01:30:14.284 --> 01:30:15.681
See that?

01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:18.287
Anyway, this is for you.

01:30:18.288 --> 01:30:21.332
It's a complete list of every
person that was at my wedding.

01:30:21.333 --> 01:30:24.168
I understand you wanted
the whole wedding video.

01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:27.004
Figured this would help
expedite the whole process, right?

01:30:27.005 --> 01:30:28.839
- There you go.
- Look,

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.090
my point is that

01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:31.842
I know you're
investigating Stratton.

01:30:31.843 --> 01:30:35.447
But for the life of me,
I can't figure out why.

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:37.932
I know we're a little unorthodox,
we're a little

01:30:37.933 --> 01:30:40.017
loud in the way we do things.
But you gotta understand,

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:41.393
we're the new guys on the block,
you know,

01:30:41.394 --> 01:30:44.043
we're trying to make
a name for ourselves.

01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:46.838
But I want you to
understand, we don't

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:48.631
do anything illegal.

01:30:49.361 --> 01:30:50.527
Whatsoever.

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:52.154
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.

01:30:52.155 --> 01:30:55.199
They were at my office 15 times
over the last six months.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.644
I mean, I got...
I got nothing to hide.

01:30:57.744 --> 01:31:00.829
Well, you know the SEC is
a civil regulatory agency.

01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:02.456
We pursue criminal activities.

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:05.401
Exactly! You go after
real criminals, which

01:31:05.877 --> 01:31:08.379
makes me wonder what the hell
you're investigating me for?

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:10.403
I mean, honestly...

01:31:10.632 --> 01:31:14.426
What is it that you think
that we did or do? I don't get it.

01:31:14.427 --> 01:31:15.761
Well, I...

01:31:15.762 --> 01:31:18.222
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:20.041
No, I get that. No, I understand.

01:31:20.058 --> 01:31:21.580
With that said...

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:24.228
This case got dumped on my desk...

01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:25.896
- Did it?
- You know, by a higher-up

01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:27.231
who needs to make a show

01:31:27.232 --> 01:31:29.441
of looking into the new company
on the block,

01:31:29.442 --> 01:31:30.919
- with all the press and everything.
- New loud guys.

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:32.820
And then I end up being the schmuck

01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:34.571
who does the looking. Exactly.

01:31:34.572 --> 01:31:36.657
It's just, you know...
It bothers me.

01:31:36.658 --> 01:31:38.075
We're the new guy. We're the one

01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:40.452
that's banging on Wall Street's door.
I mean, you should...

01:31:40.453 --> 01:31:42.413
You should see what's going
on at the bigger firms.

01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:44.016
I mean, I know all the information.

01:31:44.082 --> 01:31:47.061
It's true! Goldman,
Lehman Brothers, Merrill...

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:49.070
Collateralized debt obligations?

01:31:49.087 --> 01:31:50.421
This Internet stock bullshit?

01:31:50.422 --> 01:31:52.297
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:54.550
I could take you step-by-step

01:31:54.551 --> 01:31:57.370
through what exactly is occurring.

01:31:57.554 --> 01:31:59.247
All you have to do is ask.

01:31:59.305 --> 01:32:00.702
I'm available.

01:32:00.765 --> 01:32:02.433
- That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:32:02.434 --> 01:32:05.413
I don't see why a
little sitdown like this

01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:07.604
can't be profitable
for the both of us.

01:32:07.605 --> 01:32:09.940
It should. Right?
It should profit the both of us.

01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:11.588
- It should.
- Look.

01:32:12.027 --> 01:32:14.319
I'm gonna give you
my personal line.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:17.344
Five days a week,
you just call me, feel free.

01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:19.267
- I'll do that.
- Great.

01:32:21.745 --> 01:32:23.495
Are you sure you guys don't
want something to drink?

01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:25.247
You're not hungry? Nothing?

01:32:25.248 --> 01:32:26.975
- Nothing? No?
- Oh, no.

01:32:30.003 --> 01:32:31.128
Let me ask you,

01:32:31.129 --> 01:32:32.629
and if you don't wanna
get too personal,

01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:34.903
- just tell me to shut up at any time.
- Oh.

01:32:35.842 --> 01:32:38.552
Did you try to get
your broker's license at one time?

01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:41.497
Did I hear that right? Were you
trying to take a stab at Wall Street?

01:32:42.307 --> 01:32:44.308
- No?
- Who you been talking to?

01:32:44.309 --> 01:32:45.392
Who the fuck you been talking to?

01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:46.518
Well, you're investigating me.

01:32:46.519 --> 01:32:48.062
I hear things.

01:32:48.063 --> 01:32:49.506
You know what I mean?

01:32:50.523 --> 01:32:52.066
You ever think about
what would've happened

01:32:52.067 --> 01:32:54.761
if you would have
stayed the course?

01:32:55.945 --> 01:32:57.821
You know what?
When I'm riding home on the subway

01:32:57.822 --> 01:32:59.198
and my balls are fucking sweating,

01:32:59.199 --> 01:33:01.075
I'm wearing the same suit
three days in a row...

01:33:01.076 --> 01:33:02.659
Yeah, you bet I do.

01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.495
I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't, right?

01:33:04.496 --> 01:33:05.621
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

01:33:05.622 --> 01:33:06.789
What do you get...

01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:08.123
Another personal question,
no need to answer...

01:33:08.124 --> 01:33:09.583
No, that's all right, Jordan.

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:12.733
What do you pull in? 50, 60K?
Something like that?

01:33:12.754 --> 01:33:14.838
- A year? In the ballpark?
- Oh.

01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:16.381
Well, I...

01:33:16.382 --> 01:33:18.258
Let's put it this way.

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:19.551
You get a free handgun

01:33:19.552 --> 01:33:21.432
when you sign up for the Bureau.

01:33:21.721 --> 01:33:24.014
No, but it fucking pisses me off.
You know what I mean?

01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:26.266
You think about the people
that built this country,

01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:27.768
hardworking people like you.

01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:30.418
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:34.191
End of the day, you guys get
fucking skinned alive financially.

01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:36.151
It fucking makes me angry.

01:33:36.152 --> 01:33:39.301
Now the one thing about Wall Street
and this market is,

01:33:39.322 --> 01:33:41.095
for me, I feel

01:33:42.033 --> 01:33:44.493
it's good to give back.
You know, there's...

01:33:44.494 --> 01:33:46.745
There are situations where I can

01:33:46.746 --> 01:33:50.374
make those situations better
for people. You know?

01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:51.750
You know what I mean.

01:33:51.751 --> 01:33:53.273
Opportunity

01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:54.795
is everything.

01:33:54.796 --> 01:33:56.148
Exactly.

01:33:56.172 --> 01:33:58.715
Take for example,
I got this one kid, right?

01:33:58.716 --> 01:34:02.553
Went to school for environmental
science, something like that.

01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:04.471
He was bogged down
by student loans.

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:06.974
Turns out, his mother needed
triple bypass surgery.

01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:08.725
- Jesus.
- Right. Horrible situation.

01:34:08.726 --> 01:34:09.810
Sure.

01:34:09.811 --> 01:34:10.978
But we got him into the market

01:34:10.979 --> 01:34:12.729
at the right time
and chose the right stock.

01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:14.565
We gave him the right guidance.

01:34:14.566 --> 01:34:17.340
Boom! Overnight,
changed his entire life.

01:34:17.902 --> 01:34:19.486
Got to put his mother into

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:21.321
the best hospital in New York City.

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:22.489
It didn't work out for her,

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:24.283
granted, she passed
away, unfortunately.

01:34:24.284 --> 01:34:26.243
But we gave him that opportunity.

01:34:26.244 --> 01:34:27.516
You know what I'm saying?

01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:29.913
It's just about setting
up the right team,

01:34:29.914 --> 01:34:32.767
and then overnight
your life can change.

01:34:38.047 --> 01:34:40.570
What does... What does an intern...

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.927
What does an intern
make in a deal like that?

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:46.076
Well, in that situation,

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:50.080
in that particular trade,
and it was one trade,

01:34:50.268 --> 01:34:52.917
north of half a million dollars.

01:34:56.441 --> 01:34:58.775
And I'd do that for
anybody, you know,

01:34:58.776 --> 01:35:01.550
anybody that needs
the proper guidance.

01:35:21.257 --> 01:35:23.359
Can you say that again,

01:35:23.718 --> 01:35:25.286
just the way you said it?

01:35:25.762 --> 01:35:27.580
Just the same way.

01:35:29.265 --> 01:35:30.457
Oh.

01:35:31.684 --> 01:35:32.809
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:34.753
Oh, come on!
You know what I'm talking about.

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:37.253
I think what Jordan
just did is he...

01:35:37.273 --> 01:35:38.482
- If I'm not mistaken...
- No.

01:35:38.483 --> 01:35:40.692
you just tried to
bribe a federal officer.

01:35:40.693 --> 01:35:42.861
No, technically I
didn't bribe anybody.

01:35:42.862 --> 01:35:45.364
No, no, that's not the conversation
I heard, Jordan.

01:35:45.365 --> 01:35:46.949
No, no, according to
the U.S. criminal code,

01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:48.867
there needs to be an
exact dollar figure

01:35:48.868 --> 01:35:50.452
- for the exchange of services.
- Oh!

01:35:50.453 --> 01:35:52.162
That would not hold
up in a court of law.

01:35:52.163 --> 01:35:53.914
Nah, it's not howl heard it.

01:35:53.915 --> 01:35:56.667
No, no, no, that's the truth.
But I want to tell you this.

01:35:56.668 --> 01:35:57.793
Yeah.

01:35:57.794 --> 01:35:59.378
The same gentleman that told me

01:35:59.379 --> 01:36:01.213
that you tried to get
your broker's license

01:36:01.214 --> 01:36:03.442
also told me that
you are a straight arrow.

01:36:03.466 --> 01:36:05.008
He ran a security check on me.

01:36:05.009 --> 01:36:06.235
Well...

01:36:06.344 --> 01:36:09.388
Yeah, when you sail
on a boat fit for a Bond villain,

01:36:09.389 --> 01:36:11.617
sometimes you need to
play the part. Right?

01:36:12.850 --> 01:36:14.851
I think it's time you both
get the fuck off my boat.

01:36:14.852 --> 01:36:16.920
What do you say? Hmm?

01:36:17.230 --> 01:36:18.522
You know, Jordan,
I'll tell you something.

01:36:18.523 --> 01:36:21.627
Most of the Wall Street jackasses
that I bust,

01:36:21.985 --> 01:36:24.403
they're to the manor born.

01:36:24.404 --> 01:36:25.570
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

01:36:25.571 --> 01:36:27.281
Their fathers are douchebags,

01:36:27.282 --> 01:36:29.305
just like their
fathers before them.

01:36:30.326 --> 01:36:31.803
But you...

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:35.852
You, Jordan,
you got this way all on your own.

01:36:35.915 --> 01:36:37.141
Did I?

01:36:37.166 --> 01:36:39.314
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

01:36:39.377 --> 01:36:40.711
Good for you.

01:36:40.712 --> 01:36:41.962
Me, the little man?

01:36:41.963 --> 01:36:43.088
And let me tell you something.

01:36:43.089 --> 01:36:45.157
Let me tell you something else.

01:36:45.383 --> 01:36:47.384
Honestly,
I'm not bullshitting here,

01:36:47.385 --> 01:36:48.552
this is one of the nicest boats

01:36:48.553 --> 01:36:50.679
- that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you.
- I bet it is.

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.360
And you know
what I was just thinking, too?

01:36:52.598 --> 01:36:55.600
The fucking hero that I'm
gonna be back at the office

01:36:55.601 --> 01:36:57.874
when the Bureau seizes
this fucking boat.

01:36:57.895 --> 01:37:00.147
Because, I mean,
fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,

01:37:00.148 --> 01:37:01.815
look at this thing!

01:37:01.816 --> 01:37:02.899
It's beautiful!

01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:05.986
And you got the beautiful
girls there. It's wonderful.

01:37:05.987 --> 01:37:08.510
All right, get the
fuck off my boat.

01:37:08.614 --> 01:37:10.240
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other

01:37:10.241 --> 01:37:11.366
- real soon.
- I'm sure.

01:37:11.367 --> 01:37:12.909
Good luck on that subway ride home

01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:14.911
to your miserable,
ugly fucking wives.

01:37:14.912 --> 01:37:18.081
I'm gonna have Heidi lick some
caviar off my balls in the meantime.

01:37:18.082 --> 01:37:20.834
Hey, you guys want to take some
lobsters for your ride home?

01:37:20.835 --> 01:37:23.545
Fucking miserable pricks,
I know you can't afford them!

01:37:23.546 --> 01:37:25.444
Fucking cheap fucks.

01:37:25.757 --> 01:37:28.030
Fucking miserable pricks.

01:37:28.092 --> 01:37:31.345
Hey, fellas! Look what I
found in my pocket! Look!

01:37:31.346 --> 01:37:33.180
A year's salary right here.

01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:35.932
You know what I call them?
Fun coupons!

01:37:35.933 --> 01:37:37.285
See that!

01:37:37.727 --> 01:37:39.829
They're fun coupons!

01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:50.389
Switzerland?
What the fuck is in Switzerland?

01:37:50.406 --> 01:37:52.491
<i>Swiss fucking banks, that's what.</i>

01:37:52.492 --> 01:37:55.266
<i>It was ass-covering time.
I had to hide my money.</i>

01:37:56.454 --> 01:37:58.056
<i>Enter Rugrat.</i>

01:37:58.122 --> 01:37:59.790
<i>He knew this Swiss banker
from law school.</i>

01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:00.957
That's for European pussy!

01:38:00.958 --> 01:38:02.292
<i>But he was in Geneva.</i>

01:38:02.293 --> 01:38:04.737
<i>And there was no way
I was gonna make that flight sober.</i>

01:38:06.464 --> 01:38:08.215
<i>So I knew if I took my drugs right,</i>

01:38:08.216 --> 01:38:10.364
<i>I could sleep through
the entire flight.</i>

01:38:10.676 --> 01:38:13.120
<i>But I had to take them just right.</i>

01:38:13.638 --> 01:38:15.740
<i>At 4:00 p.m., I popped
a few more ludes,</i>

01:38:15.765 --> 01:38:17.307
<i>which started kicking
in by the time</i>

01:38:17.308 --> 01:38:19.160
<i>I finished my sales meeting.</i>

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:20.627
<i>My tingle phase.</i>

01:38:20.812 --> 01:38:22.604
<i>By dinner, I popped a few more</i>

01:38:22.605 --> 01:38:25.629
<i>on top of some cocktails
and a Valium or two.</i>

01:38:25.691 --> 01:38:27.259
<i>My slur phase.</i>

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.764
<i>By 8:30, I took a few more ludes</i>

01:38:31.906 --> 01:38:34.600
<i>and pretty much lost
all my motor skills.</i>

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:36.344
<i>This was the drool phase.</i>

01:38:39.288 --> 01:38:42.749
<i>And by 10:00, I didn't know
who or what the fuck I was.</i>

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:44.443
<i>The amnesia phase.</i>

01:38:45.253 --> 01:38:47.295
<i>We boarded the plane
just before midnight.</i>

01:38:47.296 --> 01:38:49.089
Wow! Look at you!

01:38:49.090 --> 01:38:51.158
- You're beautiful.
- Excuse me, sir.

01:38:51.259 --> 01:38:53.510
His sleeping pills just kicked in.
He's all right.

01:38:53.511 --> 01:38:55.137
May I see your
boarding passes, sir?

01:38:55.138 --> 01:38:56.956
We have the boarding passes.

01:38:57.014 --> 01:38:59.116
Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.

01:38:59.642 --> 01:39:01.460
Hey! Fucking relax.

01:39:01.519 --> 01:39:03.687
Oh, my God! You got your
hand on my fucking cock!

01:39:03.688 --> 01:39:05.147
I don't. Cut it out.

01:39:05.148 --> 01:39:06.189
He's got his hand on my dick again.

01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:07.315
I'm just trying to buckle you up.

01:39:07.316 --> 01:39:08.608
You got your hand on his dick?

01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:10.632
You gotta stop doing that
in public places.

01:39:10.653 --> 01:39:12.721
Oh, my God. Take it off!

01:39:12.864 --> 01:39:13.989
Take it off!

01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:17.060
I heard there's a treasure map
under here.

01:39:17.452 --> 01:39:19.453
- Stop! I know, miss.
- Excuse me, sir.

01:39:19.454 --> 01:39:20.976
Please sit down.

01:39:21.164 --> 01:39:22.539
- Watch it.
- Go back to your seat, please.

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:24.938
- What are you upset about?
- Please go back to your seat.

01:39:25.293 --> 01:39:26.877
I will have to call the captain.

01:39:26.878 --> 01:39:29.504
Please, sir, please, sir. Sit down.

01:39:29.505 --> 01:39:31.256
- Please sit down!
- Ow!

01:39:31.257 --> 01:39:32.883
- I'm going! Stop.
- Okay, sorry.

01:39:32.884 --> 01:39:34.577
We apologize.
We're gonna go to sleep.

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:36.077
Question. I wanna
ask you a question.

01:39:36.095 --> 01:39:37.492
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

01:39:38.097 --> 01:39:39.723
We cannot take off
if you haven't fastened

01:39:39.724 --> 01:39:40.849
- your seat belt.
- I'm really horny, too.

01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:42.058
Sit down. Fasten it.

01:39:42.059 --> 01:39:43.643
- Right. Okay, I'll sit down...
- I will do it for you.

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:44.728
- What?
- I'll do it for you.

01:39:44.729 --> 01:39:45.979
You gotta speak English.

01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:48.023
We don't understand
this language you're speaking.

01:39:48.024 --> 01:39:49.626
I will help him with his seat belt.

01:39:50.735 --> 01:39:52.896
- You gotta put it on right.
- Sit back. Sit back, sir.

01:39:52.904 --> 01:39:54.988
- There you go.
- All right. I'll just lean back...

01:39:57.241 --> 01:39:59.014
<i>Bitte, Hilfe!</i>

01:40:14.217 --> 01:40:15.592
Jesus Christ!

01:40:15.593 --> 01:40:17.070
Fuck!

01:40:18.638 --> 01:40:20.096
Donnie...

01:40:20.097 --> 01:40:23.326
Donnie, this isn't funny.
You gotta untie me, buddy.

01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:25.644
I can't untie you.

01:40:25.645 --> 01:40:27.020
The captain tied you up.

01:40:27.021 --> 01:40:28.589
He almost fucking tasered you.

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.587
Why?

01:40:30.816 --> 01:40:31.963
Why?

01:40:33.569 --> 01:40:34.886
He's got a fear of flying.

01:40:36.072 --> 01:40:37.549
Ah!

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:40.784
He's very nervous
on planes, I'm sorry,

01:40:40.785 --> 01:40:42.808
it's not you, sweetheart,
don't beat yourself up.

01:40:42.954 --> 01:40:45.807
Easy, easy. He's fine.
He's just a nervous flyer.

01:40:46.123 --> 01:40:48.124
You were screaming at people.

01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:49.584
Oh, fuck off.

01:40:49.585 --> 01:40:51.795
You were on the floor
rolling around and shit.

01:40:51.796 --> 01:40:52.921
Oh, Jesus.

01:40:52.922 --> 01:40:55.090
You called the captain the N-word.

01:40:55.091 --> 01:40:56.675
I called the captain the N-word?

01:40:56.676 --> 01:40:59.199
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- Really?

01:40:59.303 --> 01:41:01.747
- Luckily we're in first class.
- Jesus.

01:41:02.181 --> 01:41:05.410
Jesus Christ, I think
you have a fucking drug problem.

01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:07.957
Where are the ludes?

01:41:07.979 --> 01:41:09.080
Where are the ludes?

01:41:09.814 --> 01:41:11.606
They're up my ass.
Don't worry about it.

01:41:11.607 --> 01:41:13.316
- I got it.
- Okay.

01:41:13.317 --> 01:41:15.010
Thank God.

01:41:15.444 --> 01:41:16.778
Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do

01:41:16.779 --> 01:41:17.904
when we get to Switzerland, buddy?

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:18.989
This is bad.

01:41:18.990 --> 01:41:20.991
Fucking things are against my
chest. I can't breathe.

01:41:20.992 --> 01:41:22.701
Come on, do something
to calm me down. Please.

01:41:22.702 --> 01:41:24.536
Okay, shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

01:41:25.788 --> 01:41:26.980
Okay. Shh! Shh!

01:41:28.082 --> 01:41:29.165
That's good.

01:41:29.166 --> 01:41:30.959
- Go to sleep.
- Rub it harder, buddy.

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:32.653
You're all right.

01:41:32.837 --> 01:41:35.235
We all love you. Shut the fuck up!

01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:42.322
Mr. Belfort,

01:41:42.555 --> 01:41:43.952
you're free to go.

01:41:45.975 --> 01:41:47.122
Really?

01:41:50.104 --> 01:41:51.187
Whoo!

01:41:51.188 --> 01:41:52.397
- Hey, Donnie.
- Yeah?

01:41:52.398 --> 01:41:54.190
When we get out there,
try not to act like yourself.

01:41:54.191 --> 01:41:56.359
Okay? Let's make Geneva an
asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.819
What are you
fucking coming at me for?

01:41:57.820 --> 01:41:59.446
Hey, listen. The only reason
you're sitting in this limo

01:41:59.447 --> 01:42:01.072
and not in a Swiss jail
is because of my friend. Okay?

01:42:01.073 --> 01:42:02.157
<i>Hilfe!</i>

01:42:03.326 --> 01:42:05.849
We're here. We're here.
Everyone calm down.

01:42:06.287 --> 01:42:07.809
Jordan Belfort!

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:09.039
At last.

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:11.768
Nicholas has told me
so much about you.

01:42:11.876 --> 01:42:13.853
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.

01:42:13.878 --> 01:42:16.119
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.

01:42:16.505 --> 01:42:18.173
It's a joke.

01:42:18.174 --> 01:42:20.527
You'll understand
when you're in the fucking seat.

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.302
You need a bigger couch.
For guests.

01:42:22.303 --> 01:42:24.262
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

01:42:24.263 --> 01:42:27.207
I'm curious about
your bank secrecy laws here.

01:42:28.726 --> 01:42:32.000
Uh... Wait. Yes.
Excusez-moi, Jordan.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:35.629
Swiss custom requires
10 minutes of...

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:36.733
Blah, blah, blah.

01:42:36.734 --> 01:42:38.443
- Chit chat.
- Yeah, chit chat, thank you.

01:42:38.444 --> 01:42:40.171
before business can be discussed.

01:42:41.614 --> 01:42:42.840
Yeah.

01:42:45.534 --> 01:42:46.681
Of course.

01:42:47.244 --> 01:42:50.143
Let's get down to it.
What would you like to know?

01:42:50.581 --> 01:42:53.541
Under what circumstances
would you be obligated

01:42:53.542 --> 01:42:55.815
to cooperate with an FBI

01:42:56.087 --> 01:42:59.282
or a U.S. Justice Department
investigation, for example?

01:42:59.799 --> 01:43:01.071
<i>Ca depend.</i>

01:43:01.592 --> 01:43:02.864
<i>Ca depend?</i>

01:43:03.386 --> 01:43:04.487
<i>Oui.</i>

01:43:04.887 --> 01:43:07.661
Ca depend on what, exactly?

01:43:08.349 --> 01:43:10.684
Whether America plans
to invade Switzerland

01:43:10.685 --> 01:43:12.628
in the coming months.

01:43:12.728 --> 01:43:15.021
Shall I check if tanks are
rolling down the Rue de la Croy?

01:43:15.022 --> 01:43:17.216
- Yes. Rue de la Croix.
- Croix. Croix.

01:43:17.733 --> 01:43:20.235
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy.
It's Croix.

01:43:20.236 --> 01:43:22.529
See, this is what he used to do
back in law school. Check me.

01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:24.364
- Champagne. Champagne.
- Yeah.

01:43:24.365 --> 01:43:26.342
Yeah, yeah. French
fries, pommes frites.

01:43:27.493 --> 01:43:30.142
- And that kind of stuff.
- That's funny.

01:43:31.455 --> 01:43:34.207
<i>What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,</i>

01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:36.606
<i>is are you going to fuck me over?</i>

01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:42.905
<i>I understand
perfectly, you American shit.</i>

01:43:44.969 --> 01:43:47.429
The only way
the Banque Réal de Genéve

01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:49.624
would cooperate
with a foreign legal body

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.599
is if the crime being pursued

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:53.873
is also a crime in Switzerland.

01:43:53.894 --> 01:43:58.481
But there are very few Swiss laws
which apply to your practices.

01:43:58.482 --> 01:43:59.649
Hmm.

01:43:59.650 --> 01:44:01.359
From a financial standpoint,

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:02.803
you are now

01:44:03.112 --> 01:44:04.555
in heaven.

01:44:04.613 --> 01:44:06.590
See, I told you he was
fantastic, right?

01:44:07.241 --> 01:44:11.892
If the U.S. Justice Department
sent us a subpoena, it would become

01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:13.723
<i>papier toilette.</i>

01:44:14.749 --> 01:44:16.249
We would wipe our ass with it.

01:44:17.668 --> 01:44:20.336
Unless, of course, it
was an investigation

01:44:20.337 --> 01:44:22.255
into stock fraud,

01:44:22.256 --> 01:44:24.507
which is a crime here in
Switzerland, if I'm correct.

01:44:24.508 --> 01:44:28.613
Then there would have to
be <i>coopération</i> on your part,

01:44:28.637 --> 01:44:30.284
- if I'm not mistaken.
- Yes.

01:44:30.765 --> 01:44:33.288
Yes, we would. Mmm-hmm.

01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:35.828
Assuming the account is
under your name.

01:44:37.104 --> 01:44:38.706
If it were

01:44:38.856 --> 01:44:40.253
another name,

01:44:41.358 --> 01:44:43.193
a friend's, camarade...

01:44:43.194 --> 01:44:44.420
Cousin?

01:44:48.908 --> 01:44:50.726
- Relative?
- Yeah.

01:44:51.243 --> 01:44:52.469
Hmm.

01:44:52.828 --> 01:44:55.556
<i>Was that yodeling I just heard</i>

01:44:55.581 --> 01:44:58.124
<i>or did you just say
what I thought you said?</i>

01:44:58.125 --> 01:44:59.977
Yes. Yes.

01:45:00.628 --> 01:45:03.277
<i>He's telling me
to use a fucking rathole.</i>

01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:05.131
<i>But a U.S. rathole would never get</i>

01:45:05.132 --> 01:45:07.425
<i>into Switzerland
with all that money.</i>

01:45:07.426 --> 01:45:11.372
<i>What I needed was a rathole
with a European passport.</i>

01:45:18.562 --> 01:45:20.063
Jordan.

01:45:20.064 --> 01:45:23.024
Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?

01:45:23.025 --> 01:45:24.526
Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?

01:45:24.527 --> 01:45:26.174
Oh, no, not at all.

01:45:28.614 --> 01:45:30.341
Jordan, come in.

01:45:30.407 --> 01:45:33.010
<i>Thank God Aunt Emma didn't
need too much convincing.</i>

01:45:33.577 --> 01:45:36.180
<i>Turned out the British weren't
too different from the Swiss.</i>

01:45:36.247 --> 01:45:38.725
<i>Money talks and
bullshit takes the bus.</i>

01:45:39.208 --> 01:45:41.231
<i>How do you say
"rathole" in British?</i>

01:45:41.544 --> 01:45:44.087
If you get into any
trouble whatsoever,

01:45:44.088 --> 01:45:46.923
I'll come forth immediately.
I'll say that I duped you.

01:45:46.924 --> 01:45:48.321
That I promise.

01:45:48.926 --> 01:45:51.654
Risk is what keeps us young,
isn't it, darling?

01:45:55.933 --> 01:45:57.831
Sometimes I wonder

01:45:58.102 --> 01:46:01.145
if you let money get the
best of you, my love.

01:46:01.146 --> 01:46:02.372
Among

01:46:02.731 --> 01:46:04.378
other substances.

01:46:04.775 --> 01:46:06.877
Oh.

01:46:08.696 --> 01:46:10.154
It's that obvious, huh?

01:46:10.155 --> 01:46:13.509
It's chilly, darling,
and you're sweating bullets.

01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:18.063
What can I say? I'm...

01:46:18.831 --> 01:46:20.604
I'm a drug addict.

01:46:20.624 --> 01:46:22.067
I really am.

01:46:23.002 --> 01:46:24.854
Cocaine, pills.

01:46:25.254 --> 01:46:27.777
Whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.

01:46:28.215 --> 01:46:30.008
Now that's the truth.

01:46:30.009 --> 01:46:31.342
I mean...

01:46:31.343 --> 01:46:32.820
I'm a sex addict, too.

01:46:33.637 --> 01:46:36.139
Well, there are worse things
to be addicted to than sex.

01:46:37.349 --> 01:46:39.809
Jesus, why am I telling
you all this? Why am I...

01:46:39.810 --> 01:46:41.537
I'm sorry.

01:46:42.187 --> 01:46:44.506
Because I'm very easy to talk to.

01:46:44.773 --> 01:46:47.592
- You are. You are easy to talk to.
- Mmm.

01:46:48.652 --> 01:46:50.153
I suppose it's...

01:46:50.154 --> 01:46:51.676
Just my job, you know.

01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:54.574
All these people dependent on me.

01:46:54.575 --> 01:46:57.474
Tens of millions of dollars
at stake, you know.

01:46:57.661 --> 01:46:59.454
Sometimes I feel like I...

01:46:59.455 --> 01:47:02.729
I've bitten off more
than I can chew, you know.

01:47:02.833 --> 01:47:04.935
You're a man with large appetites.

01:47:05.294 --> 01:47:06.486
Yeah.

01:47:08.088 --> 01:47:10.111
<i>Is she fucking hitting on me?</i>

01:47:10.341 --> 01:47:11.488
Yeah.

01:47:11.508 --> 01:47:12.905
Yeah, I am.

01:47:15.179 --> 01:47:18.328
I suppose I put that
on myself though, right?

01:47:18.849 --> 01:47:20.496
My decision.

01:47:20.893 --> 01:47:22.435
It's just hard to...

01:47:22.436 --> 01:47:26.461
Hard to learn to control
the anxiety sometimes, you know?

01:47:26.941 --> 01:47:28.588
You know, to...

01:47:28.859 --> 01:47:31.678
Learn to relax and let go and...

01:47:32.363 --> 01:47:34.465
To release the tension.

01:47:35.407 --> 01:47:36.975
<i>She is hitting on me.</i>

01:47:37.826 --> 01:47:39.348
<i>Holy shit!</i>

01:47:39.536 --> 01:47:41.809
Yeah, to release the tension.

01:47:45.626 --> 01:47:47.478
I suppose we, uh...

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:50.364
We all just need to learn, uh...

01:47:50.881 --> 01:47:54.281
Learn to do what comes
naturally in life, you know?

01:47:56.095 --> 01:47:58.664
<i>Is he fucking hitting on me?</i>

01:48:04.770 --> 01:48:06.521
Stability, dear.

01:48:06.522 --> 01:48:08.044
Family.

01:48:14.697 --> 01:48:16.845
You take care of my niece, my love.

01:48:17.032 --> 01:48:19.305
I'll take care of
everything over here.

01:48:20.327 --> 01:48:21.428
Deal.

01:48:23.956 --> 01:48:26.650
Come on! There you go.

01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:28.026
Whoo!

01:48:28.168 --> 01:48:31.522
<i>We had, literally,
a fuckload of money.</i>

01:48:31.922 --> 01:48:34.024
<i>Aunt Emma could never
carry all this by herself.</i>

01:48:34.758 --> 01:48:38.533
<i>So I thought to myself,
who else has a European passport?</i>

01:48:38.595 --> 01:48:40.596
Brad, you're making this
too fucking tight!

01:48:40.597 --> 01:48:43.474
<i>Now Brad, as a
successful drug dealer,</i>

01:48:43.475 --> 01:48:45.768
<i>spent his winters in
the south of France,</i>

01:48:45.769 --> 01:48:47.895
<i>which is where he met
his wife, Chantalle,</i>

01:48:47.896 --> 01:48:50.875
<i>a stripper of Slovenian origin</i>

01:48:50.941 --> 01:48:52.463
<i>born, in of all places,</i>

01:48:52.943 --> 01:48:54.545
<i>Switzerland.</i>

01:48:58.615 --> 01:49:00.388
Well, this is fucked.

01:49:00.784 --> 01:49:02.511
Oh. No shit.

01:49:06.290 --> 01:49:09.018
Like, this will take
her like 50 trips.

01:49:09.043 --> 01:49:10.269
I know.

01:49:13.756 --> 01:49:15.073
Let me ask you something?

01:49:15.090 --> 01:49:17.759
What about her family? Right?

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:20.511
I mean, they all got
Swiss passports, fight

01:49:20.512 --> 01:49:22.472
She's got parents,
she's got a brother, right?

01:49:22.473 --> 01:49:24.474
The brother's got a wife.
That's five fucking people.

01:49:24.475 --> 01:49:26.476
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

01:49:26.477 --> 01:49:28.144
They're all fucking
Swiss nitwits like her.

01:49:28.145 --> 01:49:29.479
- They'll do it.
- We could do that.

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:32.023
At least I have a family,
you crooked-nose fuck!

01:49:32.024 --> 01:49:34.968
Hey, uh, don't forget
about my money.

01:49:36.653 --> 01:49:37.820
I'm sorry, what's that?

01:49:37.821 --> 01:49:39.363
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.
He's got some...

01:49:39.364 --> 01:49:41.512
- He's got some money.
- My money.

01:49:41.784 --> 01:49:44.077
I got a couple of mil
coming in like a week.

01:49:44.078 --> 01:49:46.772
When it gets in, I'll give you
a call, you come pick it up.

01:49:49.291 --> 01:49:50.813
You give me a call?

01:49:52.336 --> 01:49:55.671
When it gets here, I'll give you a
call and you'll come pick it up.

01:49:55.672 --> 01:49:57.445
Well, we don't fucking
work for you, man!

01:49:57.466 --> 01:49:58.988
Sweetheart,

01:49:59.134 --> 01:50:01.052
you have my money
taped to your tits.

01:50:01.053 --> 01:50:03.155
Okay? Technically,
you do work for me.

01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:07.793
Hey, Jordan,
we're gonna need to talk.

01:50:07.935 --> 01:50:09.519
If I fucking do this,
I'm telling you right now,

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:10.561
I ain't going to him, okay.

01:50:10.562 --> 01:50:11.687
- I'm not a fucking <i>shvartze.</i>
- I got it.

01:50:11.688 --> 01:50:13.064
I don't do fucking
pickups, all right?

01:50:13.065 --> 01:50:14.190
- I got it.
- Well, listen to me.

01:50:14.191 --> 01:50:15.858
We meet someplace
that I fucking say.

01:50:15.859 --> 01:50:17.318
And you tell that
fucking piece of shit,

01:50:17.319 --> 01:50:18.569
- he comes correct.
- I will.

01:50:18.570 --> 01:50:20.947
He comes in all fucking loopy
and fucked up, I swear to God

01:50:20.948 --> 01:50:22.865
I'll mash that
douchebag's teeth in.

01:50:22.866 --> 01:50:24.700
You're gonna mash
whose fucking teeth in?

01:50:24.701 --> 01:50:26.494
Whose fucking teeth
are you gonna mash in?

01:50:26.495 --> 01:50:28.871
I put the money on that
fucking table! Not you!

01:50:28.872 --> 01:50:30.790
I'm the reason
we have this whole fucking deal!

01:50:30.791 --> 01:50:32.875
- He's got a gun, you fucking idiot!
- Fuck his gun!

01:50:32.876 --> 01:50:34.168
I put that money in there!

01:50:34.169 --> 01:50:35.795
You know what?
You're a fucking pill dealer.

01:50:35.796 --> 01:50:38.172
I got five more just like you, bro.

01:50:38.173 --> 01:50:39.966
Keep talking,
you fucking piece of shit!

01:50:39.967 --> 01:50:41.801
You know what else?
You dress like shit!

01:50:41.802 --> 01:50:42.885
So fuck you!

01:50:42.886 --> 01:50:44.720
- Fucking motherfucker!
- Oh! Jesus!

01:50:44.721 --> 01:50:46.823
How about that, faggot?
Who's a faggot?

01:50:47.057 --> 01:50:48.659
You okay? Hey, pal.

01:50:51.186 --> 01:50:54.063
<i>The next day,
Aunt Emma flew to Geneva.</i>

01:50:54.064 --> 01:50:56.482
<i>Two million in cash
in her carry-on,</i>

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:57.900
<i>which in the big picture</i>

01:50:57.901 --> 01:50:59.628
<i>was a drop in the Swiss bucket.</i>

01:51:00.696 --> 01:51:02.071
<i>'Cause the following month,</i>

01:51:02.072 --> 01:51:04.031
<i>over the course of six round trips,</i>

01:51:04.032 --> 01:51:05.741
<i>Chantalle's family and friends</i>

01:51:05.742 --> 01:51:08.161
<i>smuggled in over 20 million in cash</i>

01:51:08.162 --> 01:51:10.014
<i>without even a hiccup.</i>

01:51:14.918 --> 01:51:16.919
- And I have some more.
- Really?

01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:18.212
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

01:51:18.213 --> 01:51:19.422
<i>And here.</i>

01:51:19.423 --> 01:51:20.715
Welcome.

01:51:20.716 --> 01:51:21.883
<i>Welcome.</i>

01:51:21.884 --> 01:51:24.177
- Yeah, like four bags of it.
- Ooh!

01:51:25.387 --> 01:51:27.805
Are you Swiss-Slovakian
or Swiss-Slovenian?

01:51:27.806 --> 01:51:29.432
- Slovenian.
- Slovenian?

01:51:29.433 --> 01:51:30.808
Who cares. You're blonde.

01:51:30.809 --> 01:51:31.910
Oh, stop.

01:51:52.581 --> 01:51:53.789
Shit.

01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:57.023
Just put the fucking car in
park, you dumb fucking idiot!

01:51:58.462 --> 01:52:00.171
I can't close this briefcase.

01:52:00.172 --> 01:52:01.631
One fucking day.

01:52:01.632 --> 01:52:03.674
One fucking day,
you couldn't keep it together?

01:52:03.675 --> 01:52:05.368
I'm fucked up, Brad.

01:52:05.802 --> 01:52:08.530
- Gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Fucked up.

01:52:13.268 --> 01:52:14.852
- It's a joke.
- It's a joke?

01:52:14.853 --> 01:52:16.896
- I'm sober.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

01:52:16.897 --> 01:52:17.980
It's a fucking joke.

01:52:17.981 --> 01:52:19.649
- Are you fucking stupid?
- I'm not stupid.

01:52:19.650 --> 01:52:21.192
You fucking drive in here
like a fucking maniac,

01:52:21.193 --> 01:52:23.110
you know the attention that
that fucking draws?

01:52:23.111 --> 01:52:25.863
- I'm not stupid. I'm smart.
- Smart?

01:52:25.864 --> 01:52:28.032
- I make million-dollar deals.
- That right?

01:52:28.033 --> 01:52:30.493
With smart important
people, unlike you.

01:52:30.494 --> 01:52:32.870
People who don't
sucker-punch people

01:52:32.871 --> 01:52:34.455
when they're scared. Okay?

01:52:34.456 --> 01:52:35.915
- I'm scared, huh?
- And by the way,

01:52:35.916 --> 01:52:36.999
I haven't gotten an
apology yet for that.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.125
You want an apology, okay.

01:52:38.126 --> 01:52:39.669
I check my fucking
messages every day

01:52:39.670 --> 01:52:40.753
- when I come home from work.
- Did you?

01:52:40.754 --> 01:52:42.004
- My answering machine. Zero.
- Didn't get one, huh?

01:52:42.005 --> 01:52:43.130
I got a blinking light,

01:52:43.131 --> 01:52:44.507
because I don't have shit from you.

01:52:44.508 --> 01:52:45.800
You know what,
you got a big fucking mouth, okay?

01:52:45.801 --> 01:52:47.134
I got my wife checking the messages

01:52:47.135 --> 01:52:49.220
every 45 minutes
calling the office, saying,

01:52:49.221 --> 01:52:50.513
"Has Brad apologized yet?

01:52:50.514 --> 01:52:52.598
"Is there an apology message
on the machine?"

01:52:52.599 --> 01:52:54.225
I don't have jack shit.
You know what?

01:52:54.226 --> 01:52:55.726
That's not how you treat people.

01:52:55.727 --> 01:52:56.852
You got a big fucking
mouth, you know.

01:52:56.853 --> 01:52:58.604
I'm gonna give you a fucking pass.
Just give me the case.

01:52:58.605 --> 01:53:00.898
You're gonna give me a pass?

01:53:00.899 --> 01:53:02.566
Look, it's a figure
of fucking speech.

01:53:02.567 --> 01:53:04.610
Oh, my gosh.
The Emperor of Fucksville

01:53:04.611 --> 01:53:05.987
came down from Fucksville
to give me a pass!

01:53:05.988 --> 01:53:07.071
From Fucksville, huh?

01:53:07.072 --> 01:53:09.031
Hey, what are the citizens
of Fucksville doing today

01:53:09.032 --> 01:53:10.574
when their Emperor's gone?

01:53:10.575 --> 01:53:12.201
Is it mayhem?

01:53:12.202 --> 01:53:14.078
Are people looting and raping?

01:53:14.079 --> 01:53:16.163
What are all the little fuckheads
doing while you're here?

01:53:16.164 --> 01:53:17.665
Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag.

01:53:17.666 --> 01:53:19.041
You back the fuck up.

01:53:19.042 --> 01:53:20.293
I'll cause the biggest
fucking scene

01:53:20.294 --> 01:53:22.586
that I've ever caused in my life

01:53:22.587 --> 01:53:24.422
if you come at me again.

01:53:24.423 --> 01:53:26.090
- You know what?
- Just fucking keep it down.

01:53:26.091 --> 01:53:27.383
I got...

01:53:27.384 --> 01:53:28.968
I don't wanna be out
of line or anything,

01:53:28.969 --> 01:53:32.054
but I think you like,
like me. Like you...

01:53:32.055 --> 01:53:33.597
Like when you come at me...

01:53:33.598 --> 01:53:34.765
What's the matter with you?
What the fuck is...

01:53:34.766 --> 01:53:36.267
and you look at me.
I swear I just noticed it.

01:53:36.268 --> 01:53:38.060
You have like a fucking, like...

01:53:38.061 --> 01:53:40.146
Like a twinkle.
You have like a twinkle.

01:53:40.147 --> 01:53:41.689
Are you trying to kiss me, bro?

01:53:41.690 --> 01:53:43.357
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:53:43.358 --> 01:53:45.401
- What's with you?
- I have a... I don't know.

01:53:45.402 --> 01:53:47.194
- It's not a homophobic thing.
- All right...

01:53:47.195 --> 01:53:48.988
You're just not the
one for me, pal.

01:53:48.989 --> 01:53:50.197
You know what I mean? It's not...

01:53:50.198 --> 01:53:52.199
- it's not about that for me, you know.
- I've heard enough.

01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:54.702
Please, I'm begging,
give me the fucking case.

01:53:54.703 --> 01:53:56.162
- I'm gonna give you the case.
- Give me the case.

01:53:56.163 --> 01:53:57.621
- You gotta do me one favor.
- What's that?

01:53:57.622 --> 01:53:59.373
You gotta take this case,

01:53:59.374 --> 01:54:01.000
you gotta drive straight home,

01:54:01.001 --> 01:54:02.668
need you to open up the briefcase,

01:54:02.669 --> 01:54:04.587
and you take out
every single dollar.

01:54:04.588 --> 01:54:06.630
Don't leave one dollar
inside the briefcase.

01:54:06.631 --> 01:54:07.840
And once you have it all

01:54:07.841 --> 01:54:09.717
neatly organized
outside the briefcase,

01:54:09.718 --> 01:54:12.094
I need you to take it
and I need you to shove it right up

01:54:12.095 --> 01:54:14.263
your wife's Latvian
cunt, you understand?

01:54:14.264 --> 01:54:16.015
- My fucking wife!
- Chill! Chill, bro.

01:54:16.016 --> 01:54:17.558
Fuck. You motherfucking
piece of shit!

01:54:17.559 --> 01:54:18.768
How about now?

01:54:18.769 --> 01:54:20.227
- Go, go!
- Fuck!

01:54:21.897 --> 01:54:23.689
Motherfuck! You're fucking dead!

01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:25.441
Stop! Don't move! Don't move!

01:54:25.442 --> 01:54:28.386
Stop, or I will blow
you the fuck away!

01:54:28.695 --> 01:54:30.946
Drop the case! Put
your hands in the air!

01:54:30.947 --> 01:54:32.865
Get down.

01:54:32.866 --> 01:54:34.718
Get down on your knees!
Get down on your knees!

01:54:35.327 --> 01:54:36.849
Motherfucker!

01:54:38.789 --> 01:54:39.936
Motherfucker!

01:54:48.632 --> 01:54:52.301
Jordan, do I have a
surprise for you!

01:54:52.302 --> 01:54:53.511
What's that?

01:54:53.512 --> 01:54:55.137
Twenty real Lemmons.

01:54:55.138 --> 01:54:56.389
Retired pharmacist's
client of mine,

01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:57.640
they've been in the
safe for 15 years.

01:54:57.641 --> 01:54:59.141
Are you fucking kidding me?
Lemmons?

01:54:59.142 --> 01:55:00.351
Ha-ha!

01:55:00.352 --> 01:55:02.311
They're gonna knock us
on our fucking heads.

01:55:02.312 --> 01:55:04.105
<i>When it comes to Quaaludes,</i>

01:55:04.106 --> 01:55:07.316
<i>the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.</i>

01:55:07.317 --> 01:55:08.901
- Can you believe it?
- Oh, my God.

01:55:08.902 --> 01:55:10.444
I thought they were like a myth.

01:55:10.445 --> 01:55:12.405
<i>Three times as powerful
as anything available today.</i>

01:55:12.406 --> 01:55:13.531
Look at these babies.

01:55:13.532 --> 01:55:16.200
<i>Boy, Donnie really knew
how to celebrate.</i>

01:55:16.201 --> 01:55:18.369
<i>He said he was saving these
for a special occasion.</i>

01:55:18.370 --> 01:55:21.038
<i>Like a birthday, or
being clap free,</i>

01:55:21.039 --> 01:55:24.109
<i>or our money arriving safely
in Switzerland.</i>

01:55:27.421 --> 01:55:28.754
<i>So that night,</i>

01:55:28.755 --> 01:55:30.673
<i>I cleared my schedule
and I rid my body</i>

01:55:30.674 --> 01:55:33.277
<i>of anything that
could fuck with my high.</i>

01:55:33.885 --> 01:55:35.783
<i>It was celebration time.</i>

01:55:36.263 --> 01:55:37.513
Okay.

01:55:37.514 --> 01:55:39.098
Start off with one,
see how it goes?

01:55:39.099 --> 01:55:40.933
My guy says all we'll need is one.

01:55:40.934 --> 01:55:42.456
Here you go.

01:55:43.061 --> 01:55:44.812
- Salud!
- Cheers.

01:55:44.813 --> 01:55:47.712
<i>Maybe if I pull it
again, it'll go down.</i>

01:55:49.359 --> 01:55:50.693
<i>Steve! Steve!</i>

01:55:50.694 --> 01:55:52.027
<i>I gotta get out of here!</i>

01:55:52.028 --> 01:55:53.988
<i>Carl, I think I got it figured out.</i>

01:55:53.989 --> 01:55:57.783
<i>It must be one pull for up
and two pulls for down.</i>

01:55:57.784 --> 01:55:59.136
<i>Okay.</i>

01:56:07.377 --> 01:56:09.275
Do you feel anything?

01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:13.112
No.

01:56:15.719 --> 01:56:17.636
It's been 35 minutes.

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:18.863
Hmm.

01:56:20.056 --> 01:56:21.557
Maybe we've built up a tolerance

01:56:21.558 --> 01:56:23.706
after all these years, huh?

01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:26.746
Hmm.

01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:38.240
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

01:56:38.241 --> 01:56:41.494
My metabolism's pumping.
I can't feel shit!

01:56:41.495 --> 01:56:42.745
They're old.

01:56:42.746 --> 01:56:44.997
You think they lost
their potency, huh?

01:56:44.998 --> 01:56:46.725
Check the bottle!

01:56:49.461 --> 01:56:50.961
January '81.

01:56:50.962 --> 01:56:52.129
They're fucking duds.

01:56:52.130 --> 01:56:53.255
Fuck!

01:56:53.256 --> 01:56:54.423
Let's take, uh...

01:56:54.424 --> 01:56:56.026
Let's take two more each.

01:56:57.886 --> 01:57:00.535
- Jordan.
- Yeah, baby.

01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:05.893
What are you two retards doing?

01:57:05.894 --> 01:57:07.211
We're working out, honey.

01:57:07.437 --> 01:57:09.104
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

01:57:09.105 --> 01:57:10.189
Okay.

01:57:10.190 --> 01:57:12.213
- Okay?
- Okay

01:57:13.610 --> 01:57:15.236
Hey, Bo, what's going on?

01:57:15.237 --> 01:57:16.445
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

01:57:16.446 --> 01:57:17.905
I cannot talk to you on this phone,

01:57:17.906 --> 01:57:19.114
I have to talk to you.

01:57:19.115 --> 01:57:20.699
<i>Get out of here.
What's going on?</i>

01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:24.119
Listen to me!
Leave the fucking house, Jordan,

01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:25.871
and then call me from a pay phone.

01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:27.915
This is not a fucking joke, Jordan.

01:57:27.916 --> 01:57:29.643
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:57:30.043 --> 01:57:31.460
- Shit.
- What'd he say?

01:57:31.461 --> 01:57:32.920
I don't know what the
fuck's going on.

01:57:32.921 --> 01:57:34.989
- I gotta go!
- Is everything okay, Jordan?

01:57:45.308 --> 01:57:47.142
<i>The closest pay
phone I could get to</i>

01:57:47.143 --> 01:57:49.541
<i>was at the Brookville Country Club.</i>

01:57:50.105 --> 01:57:52.147
<i>It was a real WASP stronghold,</i>

01:57:52.148 --> 01:57:54.842
<i>just a mile down the road
from my house.</i>

01:58:04.202 --> 01:58:05.703
Hey, Bo, what's up, it's me.
What's going on?

01:58:05.704 --> 01:58:06.829
I'm at a pay phone.
What's going on?

01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:08.038
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

01:58:08.039 --> 01:58:09.915
Please. Your little
friend there, Brad,

01:58:09.916 --> 01:58:11.893
your little buddy, he's in jail.

01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:13.836
What the fuck's he in jail for?

01:58:13.837 --> 01:58:15.379
<i>- What'd he do?
- I don't know what he did.</i>

01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:16.797
My friends in Long Island told me

01:58:16.798 --> 01:58:19.091
he got picked up
in some fucking shopping mall.

01:58:19.092 --> 01:58:20.175
He got locked up by...

01:58:20.176 --> 01:58:22.511
Wait, wait. Did you...
Did you say a shopping mall?

01:58:22.512 --> 01:58:23.887
- Yeah.
- He was with Donnie.

01:58:23.888 --> 01:58:25.472
He was supposed
to deliver some money,

01:58:25.473 --> 01:58:26.974
- then that fucking fat piece of shit...
<i>- Listen to me!</i>

01:58:26.975 --> 01:58:28.017
I gotta go fucking
talk to him right now!

01:58:28.018 --> 01:58:30.060
Listen to me! Don't go!
Listen to me.

01:58:30.061 --> 01:58:32.771
That guy Denham,
that FBI agent guy,

01:58:32.772 --> 01:58:35.149
somebody told me he's got
your phones tapped.

01:58:35.150 --> 01:58:36.734
Your office and your home.

01:58:36.735 --> 01:58:38.527
<i>Don't talk on the
motherfucking phone!</i>

01:58:38.528 --> 01:58:40.551
Okay. Fuck! I got it.
I got it. I got it.

01:58:40.905 --> 01:58:42.131
<i>Jordan.</i>

01:58:42.574 --> 01:58:46.452
You didn't try to bribe this
fucking FBI agent, did you?

01:58:46.453 --> 01:58:48.579
No, I didn't try to
bribe an FBI agent.

01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:50.205
You think I'm that fucking stupid?
No.

01:58:50.206 --> 01:58:52.166
<i>What the fuck did you say?
I can't understand you.</i>

01:58:52.167 --> 01:58:53.417
<i>Say that again.</i>

01:58:53.418 --> 01:58:56.317
I said...

01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:58.297
<i>What the fuck are you saying?</i>

01:58:59.382 --> 01:59:00.466
I said...

01:59:00.467 --> 01:59:02.009
<i>Are you fucking high?</i>

01:59:04.554 --> 01:59:07.282
<i>Jordan, are you fucking high?</i>

01:59:08.016 --> 01:59:10.225
<i>Jordan, do me a favor,
stay where you are.</i>

01:59:10.226 --> 01:59:11.935
<i>Don't get behind the
wheel of the car.</i>

01:59:11.936 --> 01:59:13.562
<i>I'm gonna send Rocco over
to pick you up.</i>

01:59:13.563 --> 01:59:14.897
<i>Jordan! Jordan!</i>

01:59:14.898 --> 01:59:17.232
<i>After 15 years in storage,</i>

01:59:17.233 --> 01:59:20.277
<i>the Lemmons had developed
a delayed fuse.</i>

01:59:20.278 --> 01:59:23.030
<i>It took 90 minutes for these
little fuckers to kick in.</i>

01:59:23.031 --> 01:59:24.448
<i>But once they did...</i>

01:59:24.449 --> 01:59:25.949
<i>Pow!</i>

01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:27.576
<i>I mean, I had skipped
the tingle phase</i>

01:59:27.577 --> 01:59:29.578
<i>and went straight
to the drool phase.</i>

01:59:29.579 --> 01:59:31.622
<i>Tell me where you are!
Don't fucking drive...</i>

01:59:31.623 --> 01:59:33.624
<i>These little bastards
were so strong,</i>

01:59:33.625 --> 01:59:35.751
<i>I discovered a whole new phase.</i>

01:59:35.752 --> 01:59:37.900
<i>The cerebral palsy phase.</i>

01:59:40.090 --> 01:59:42.192
<i>Come on, stand up!</i>

01:59:46.054 --> 01:59:48.077
<i>Okay, walking's out.</i>

01:59:48.932 --> 01:59:51.911
<i>All right, think, think.
What else is there?</i>

01:59:52.644 --> 01:59:56.465
<i>Yes! I can crawl.
I can crawl like Skylar!</i>

02:00:28.012 --> 02:00:31.082
<i>Fuck! The kid makes it
look so goddamn easy!</i>

02:00:38.022 --> 02:00:40.482
<i>Think, you motherfucker, think!</i>

02:00:40.483 --> 02:00:41.900
<i>Yes!</i>

02:00:41.901 --> 02:00:44.095
<i>I got it! I've got it!</i>

02:00:44.404 --> 02:00:46.677
<i>I can roll! I can roll!</i>

02:01:34.746 --> 02:01:35.972
Ah!

02:01:54.224 --> 02:01:55.416
Ah!

02:02:08.905 --> 02:02:10.239
Jordan.

02:02:11.741 --> 02:02:13.184
<i>Jordan.</i>

02:02:13.451 --> 02:02:15.202
<i>Oh, Jesus. Where are you?</i>

02:02:15.203 --> 02:02:16.745
I'm at a country club!

02:02:16.746 --> 02:02:17.871
<i>What?</i>

02:02:17.872 --> 02:02:20.791
I'm at a country club!

02:02:20.792 --> 02:02:22.209
<i>I don't know what the
fuck you're saying.</i>

02:02:22.210 --> 02:02:23.544
<i>Look, you need to get home.</i>

02:02:23.545 --> 02:02:26.255
<i>Donnie is out of control!
He's on the other line</i>

02:02:26.256 --> 02:02:28.215
<i>with some Swiss guy.
I don't know...</i>

02:02:28.216 --> 02:02:29.299
What?

02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:32.370
Get him off the phone!

02:02:32.595 --> 02:02:35.430
<i>I can't understand you!</i>

02:02:35.431 --> 02:02:36.765
Get him

02:02:36.766 --> 02:02:37.891
off

02:02:37.892 --> 02:02:39.101
the phone!

02:02:39.102 --> 02:02:40.435
<i>I don't know what the fuck
you're saying, Jordan.</i>

02:02:40.436 --> 02:02:41.854
<i>Can you just get home? Hurry!</i>

02:02:51.614 --> 02:02:53.824
<i>I was less than a mile from home.</i>

02:02:53.825 --> 02:02:56.618
<i>I drove as slow as I fucking could.</i>

02:02:56.619 --> 02:02:58.704
<i>I'd seen Jell-O move faster.</i>

02:02:58.705 --> 02:03:01.228
<i>I was gonna give you 2 million.</i>

02:03:01.291 --> 02:03:03.940
I's gonna be lates.

02:03:04.502 --> 02:03:06.195
You ate 2 million?

02:03:07.005 --> 02:03:08.338
Later.

02:03:08.339 --> 02:03:09.548
<i>Get off the phone.</i>

02:03:09.549 --> 02:03:11.133
<i>Get off the fucking phone! Idiot!</i>

02:03:12.427 --> 02:03:14.621
Get out of the way, asshole!

02:03:17.181 --> 02:03:18.515
You hate 2 million?

02:03:18.516 --> 02:03:20.118
No, you don't hate
2 million, Donnie.

02:03:22.562 --> 02:03:25.522
<i>By some miracle,
I made it home alive,</i>

02:03:25.523 --> 02:03:27.921
<i>not a scratch on me or the car.</i>

02:03:37.243 --> 02:03:38.827
Jordan?

02:03:38.828 --> 02:03:41.496
Jesus fucking Christ!

02:03:41.497 --> 02:03:43.081
What did you take?

02:03:43.082 --> 02:03:44.458
What's wrong with you?

02:03:44.459 --> 02:03:45.542
Jor!

02:03:45.543 --> 02:03:48.003
It's fucking good, right?

02:03:48.004 --> 02:03:49.379
Fucked up!

02:03:50.673 --> 02:03:52.616
Get off the phone!

02:03:55.553 --> 02:03:57.846
What the fuck, Jordan?

02:03:57.847 --> 02:03:59.514
Your daughter's in the house!

02:03:59.515 --> 02:04:00.682
I hope you know that!

02:04:00.683 --> 02:04:02.059
Your fucking daughter's
in the house!

02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:04.061
Yeah, it's real fucking
funny, Donnie.

02:04:04.062 --> 02:04:06.521
Get off the phone!

02:04:07.649 --> 02:04:08.690
Jesus Christ, Jordan.

02:04:08.691 --> 02:04:10.464
The FBI!

02:04:11.694 --> 02:04:13.046
Hey!

02:04:13.488 --> 02:04:15.465
I'm on phone!

02:04:15.573 --> 02:04:18.051
Get off the fucking phone!

02:04:19.702 --> 02:04:21.804
- Come here!
- ...the phone.

02:04:23.790 --> 02:04:27.019
Come on.
We're gonna go upstairs, all right.

02:04:28.878 --> 02:04:30.070
Ow!

02:04:31.798 --> 02:04:33.382
I'm on the phone!

02:04:33.383 --> 02:04:34.800
On the phone!

02:04:34.801 --> 02:04:36.995
I know what you did,

02:04:37.387 --> 02:04:38.887
you piece of shit!

02:04:38.888 --> 02:04:40.681
What? What?

02:04:40.682 --> 02:04:42.125
Brad!

02:04:42.475 --> 02:04:43.725
Huh?

02:04:43.726 --> 02:04:45.294
Brad!

02:04:45.687 --> 02:04:46.979
Brad!

02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:49.503
You fucking cocksucker!

02:04:53.736 --> 02:04:55.696
What did you do,

02:04:55.697 --> 02:04:57.572
you piece of shit?

02:04:57.573 --> 02:04:59.095
Fuck you!

02:05:00.243 --> 02:05:02.619
I wanna fucking kill you!

02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:04.893
I wanna fucking kill you!

02:05:05.748 --> 02:05:07.191
I got you!

02:05:31.649 --> 02:05:33.672
What the fuck happened?

02:05:34.027 --> 02:05:35.360
Oh, shit!

02:05:35.361 --> 02:05:37.338
Jordan? Jordan, are you all right?

02:05:37.405 --> 02:05:39.098
Donnie? Donnie?

02:05:39.323 --> 02:05:40.490
Donnie?

02:05:40.491 --> 02:05:41.908
Jordan, he's not breathing.

02:05:41.909 --> 02:05:43.785
Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do.

02:05:43.786 --> 02:05:45.120
Jordan, I don't know
what the fuck to do!

02:05:45.121 --> 02:05:46.768
I can't help him!
Oh, my God. Jordan.

02:05:48.499 --> 02:05:51.126
Oh, my God, I think he's choking,
Jordan. Do something.

02:05:51.127 --> 02:05:52.979
- Oh, God.
- Baby, I got you!

02:05:53.463 --> 02:05:56.442
He's not breathing, Jordan.
You gotta do something!

02:05:57.258 --> 02:05:59.656
Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

02:05:59.969 --> 02:06:01.470
<i>Ah!</i>

02:06:01.471 --> 02:06:02.888
I got you.

02:06:19.697 --> 02:06:20.798
Oh!

02:06:22.158 --> 02:06:23.851
Step aside!

02:06:23.993 --> 02:06:25.470
Oh, God!

02:06:25.828 --> 02:06:27.396
Oh, God!

02:06:27.663 --> 02:06:29.515
Move aside, baby.

02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:38.256
Come on! Come on!

02:06:38.257 --> 02:06:39.574
Come on!

02:06:44.013 --> 02:06:46.787
Jordan, he's not breathing.
You gotta do something.

02:06:47.725 --> 02:06:49.851
Jordan, he's a father!
He's got fucking kids!

02:06:49.852 --> 02:06:51.625
- Do something!
- Yeah?

02:06:57.193 --> 02:06:58.360
Rocco, you gotta get over here.

02:06:58.361 --> 02:07:00.362
- Come on.
- Call an ambulance!

02:07:00.363 --> 02:07:01.613
I don't fucking know!

02:07:01.614 --> 02:07:03.406
Just get over here! Call 911.

02:07:11.415 --> 02:07:12.516
Yeah.

02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:16.404
You all right? He's all right.

02:07:29.517 --> 02:07:31.711
Mr. Belfort?

02:07:32.562 --> 02:07:34.130
Mr. Belfort?

02:07:36.691 --> 02:07:39.693
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Fuck.

02:07:39.694 --> 02:07:42.297
Sir, we need to ask
you some questions.

02:07:42.864 --> 02:07:44.906
Are you fucking kidding me?
Fuck you.

02:07:44.907 --> 02:07:46.074
Come on, get up.

02:07:46.075 --> 02:07:47.768
Get the fuck out of my house.

02:07:49.453 --> 02:07:51.246
- Let's go.
- I've been here all night.

02:07:51.247 --> 02:07:52.831
I been sitting here all night.

02:07:52.832 --> 02:07:54.291
What the fuck are
you talking about?

02:07:54.292 --> 02:07:56.334
- Where you taking him?
- Where you taking me?

02:07:56.335 --> 02:07:57.502
Where you taking him?

02:07:57.503 --> 02:07:58.587
You ain't got no warrant.

02:07:58.588 --> 02:08:00.228
Just come up in people's
house like that!

02:08:01.090 --> 02:08:03.425
Did you drive your car tonight,
Mr. Belfort?

02:08:03.426 --> 02:08:04.698
Huh?

02:08:04.927 --> 02:08:06.119
Well?

02:08:09.265 --> 02:08:10.787
<i>Wow!</i>

02:08:10.975 --> 02:08:12.873
<i>Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.</i>

02:08:27.909 --> 02:08:30.387
Get out of the fucking way!

02:08:32.246 --> 02:08:33.598
Fuck!

02:08:39.128 --> 02:08:41.129
Did you drive

02:08:41.130 --> 02:08:42.857
that car tonight?

02:08:43.883 --> 02:08:46.092
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

02:08:46.093 --> 02:08:47.969
I'm a family man!

02:08:47.970 --> 02:08:49.804
Family man. Honey!

02:08:49.805 --> 02:08:51.806
<i>It was a miracle I wasn't killed,</i>

02:08:51.807 --> 02:08:54.935
<i>or that I didn't kill anybody else.</i>

02:08:54.936 --> 02:08:56.686
<i>The cops took me in
for questioning,</i>

02:08:56.687 --> 02:08:58.146
<i>but they couldn't charge me.</i>

02:08:58.147 --> 02:09:00.690
<i>They had no proof
I was even behind the wheel.</i>

02:09:00.691 --> 02:09:01.816
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

02:09:01.817 --> 02:09:03.985
<i>Brad did three months
in jail for contempt</i>

02:09:03.986 --> 02:09:06.655
<i>because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.</i>

02:09:06.656 --> 02:09:07.781
<i>The result,</i>

02:09:07.782 --> 02:09:09.491
<i>I was soot-free.</i>

02:09:09.492 --> 02:09:11.952
<i>But I had eyes on me
like never before.</i>

02:09:11.953 --> 02:09:13.662
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

02:09:13.663 --> 02:09:16.665
You're lucky to be alive,
let alone not in jail.

02:09:16.666 --> 02:09:18.333
You know I don't believe
in luck, right?

02:09:18.334 --> 02:09:19.793
But it's time.

02:09:19.794 --> 02:09:22.128
Please, let me call the SEC
and cut a deal

02:09:22.129 --> 02:09:24.130
before your luck runs out.

02:09:24.131 --> 02:09:25.799
Wave to Daddy.

02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:26.967
Hey.

02:09:26.968 --> 02:09:28.570
Hey, sweetie.

02:09:33.683 --> 02:09:37.018
What kind of terms would you
be talking about if I...

02:09:37.019 --> 02:09:38.353
I don't know.

02:09:38.354 --> 02:09:41.398
You plead guilty to a handful
of securities violations,

02:09:41.399 --> 02:09:44.526
stock manipulation,
high-pressure sales tactics.

02:09:44.527 --> 02:09:47.362
Ticky-tack shit like
that, you know.

02:09:47.363 --> 02:09:49.447
You pay a couple million
dollars in fines,

02:09:49.448 --> 02:09:52.472
in exchange, the SEC fucks
off till the end of time.

02:09:54.745 --> 02:09:56.472
And Stratton?

02:09:56.872 --> 02:09:58.832
What happens to Stratton?

02:09:58.833 --> 02:10:01.710
There's no way... I mean...
You got to walk away. Right?

02:10:01.711 --> 02:10:02.961
Let Donnie be in charge.

02:10:02.962 --> 02:10:04.655
Right. Donnie.

02:10:05.298 --> 02:10:07.549
Now the FBI is
another animal completely.

02:10:07.550 --> 02:10:09.384
They'll still be pursuing you
for criminal wrongdoing.

02:10:09.385 --> 02:10:12.220
However, with you stepping
down voluntarily,

02:10:12.221 --> 02:10:14.264
my guess is that
your best friend Agent Denham

02:10:14.265 --> 02:10:16.709
will be standing around
with his dick in his hand.

02:10:17.727 --> 02:10:19.060
Jordan.

02:10:19.061 --> 02:10:21.104
What do you have to think about?

02:10:21.105 --> 02:10:22.731
You beat them.

02:10:22.732 --> 02:10:23.982
You won!

02:10:23.983 --> 02:10:25.692
God knows you never
have to work again.

02:10:25.693 --> 02:10:27.736
What're you gonna do?
Spend the rest of your life in jail?

02:10:27.737 --> 02:10:28.903
- Is that what you want?
- No.

02:10:28.904 --> 02:10:30.071
- Of course not.
- Okay.

02:10:30.072 --> 02:10:32.198
Okay! You got all the
money in the world.

02:10:32.199 --> 02:10:33.867
You need everybody else's money?

02:10:33.868 --> 02:10:35.368
- Of course not, Pops.
- Well?

02:10:35.369 --> 02:10:37.746
- You know, I built it.
- I know you built it.

02:10:37.747 --> 02:10:39.599
You built it, so now preserve it.

02:11:10.738 --> 02:11:12.215
You know,

02:11:12.531 --> 02:11:15.325
five years ago, when I
started Stratton Oakmont

02:11:15.326 --> 02:11:17.452
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day

02:11:17.453 --> 02:11:20.898
would eventually come
where I'd have to be moving on.

02:11:22.750 --> 02:11:24.376
And it's truly with a heavy heart

02:11:24.377 --> 02:11:26.650
that I'm here to say that...

02:11:28.130 --> 02:11:30.507
That that day is finally here.

02:11:34.553 --> 02:11:36.930
I wanna...
I want to thank you all for your...

02:11:36.931 --> 02:11:39.682
Your years of loyalty
and admiration.

02:11:39.683 --> 02:11:41.285
But the point is this.

02:11:42.144 --> 02:11:43.478
Under Donnie's leadership,

02:11:43.479 --> 02:11:47.023
along with Nicky Koskoff
and Robbie Feinberg

02:11:47.024 --> 02:11:49.943
moving into key management
positions, this place really

02:11:49.944 --> 02:11:51.319
is gonna be better than ever!

02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:53.593
That I promise you. Okay?

02:11:53.823 --> 02:11:56.426
Give them a round of applause.
Come on.

02:11:59.453 --> 02:12:02.247
This is Ellis Island here, people.

02:12:02.248 --> 02:12:03.998
I don't care who you are,
where you're from,

02:12:03.999 --> 02:12:06.626
whether your relatives came
over on the fucking Mayflower

02:12:06.627 --> 02:12:08.837
or on an inner tube from Haiti,

02:12:08.838 --> 02:12:11.172
this right here is the
land of opportunity.

02:12:11.173 --> 02:12:13.776
Stratton Oakmont is America!

02:12:17.721 --> 02:12:19.472
All of you know
Kimmie Belzer, right?

02:12:19.473 --> 02:12:20.723
Yes, we do.

02:12:20.724 --> 02:12:21.933
Fuck you.

02:12:21.934 --> 02:12:23.852
Come on, Kimmie.

02:12:23.853 --> 02:12:25.437
What you probably didn't know is,

02:12:25.438 --> 02:12:27.355
Kimmie was one of
the first brokers here,

02:12:27.356 --> 02:12:29.709
one of Stratton's original 20.

02:12:30.359 --> 02:12:32.318
Now most of you met Kimmie,

02:12:32.319 --> 02:12:35.423
the beautiful sophisticated woman
that she is today.

02:12:35.698 --> 02:12:38.927
A woman that wears
$3,000 Armani suits.

02:12:40.786 --> 02:12:43.480
Who drives a brand-new
Mercedes-Benz.

02:12:44.039 --> 02:12:45.957
A woman who spends

02:12:45.958 --> 02:12:47.500
her winters in the Bahamas

02:12:47.501 --> 02:12:49.695
and summers in the Hamptons!

02:12:54.592 --> 02:12:57.036
That's not the Kimmie that I met.

02:12:59.763 --> 02:13:03.663
The Kimmie that I met didn't have
two nickels to rub together.

02:13:04.768 --> 02:13:07.103
She was a single mom
on the balls of her ass

02:13:07.104 --> 02:13:09.022
with an 8-year-old son.

02:13:09.023 --> 02:13:12.127
Okay? She was
three months behind on her rent.

02:13:13.068 --> 02:13:16.863
And when she came to me
and asked me for a job,

02:13:16.864 --> 02:13:19.115
she asked for a $5,000 advance

02:13:19.116 --> 02:13:22.390
just so she could pay
her son's tuition.

02:13:26.749 --> 02:13:28.583
And what'd I do, Kimmie?

02:13:28.584 --> 02:13:30.357
Go on, tell them.

02:13:32.046 --> 02:13:34.194
You wrote me a check

02:13:34.298 --> 02:13:36.526
for $25,000.

02:13:37.718 --> 02:13:39.240
That's right.

02:13:39.261 --> 02:13:40.704
Thank you.

02:13:44.016 --> 02:13:45.868
And you know why that is?

02:13:49.104 --> 02:13:51.548
It's because I believed in you.

02:13:53.108 --> 02:13:55.927
It's because I believed
in you, Kimmie,

02:13:56.278 --> 02:13:58.112
just like I believe in each

02:13:58.113 --> 02:14:00.240
and every one of you here today.

02:14:00.241 --> 02:14:02.700
- I fucking love you, Jordan!
- I fucking love you.

02:14:02.701 --> 02:14:04.619
I fucking love you! I love you.

02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:07.519
I fucking love you, too!
I fucking love you, too!

02:14:10.292 --> 02:14:12.394
And I love all of you!

02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:15.296
And I love all of you
from the bottom of my heart.

02:14:15.297 --> 02:14:17.900
- I fucking love you, too.
- I mean that.

02:14:18.634 --> 02:14:20.987
You are the shit.
You are the fucking shit.

02:14:27.393 --> 02:14:29.666
It's a shame, you know.

02:14:31.146 --> 02:14:33.231
For years, I've been
telling you guys

02:14:33.232 --> 02:14:35.358
never to take no for
an answer, right?

02:14:35.359 --> 02:14:38.679
You know, to keep pushing,
to never hang up the phone

02:14:39.488 --> 02:14:41.841
until you get what you want.

02:14:42.658 --> 02:14:44.476
Because you all deserve it.

02:14:46.412 --> 02:14:49.732
You know, this fucking deal
that I'm about to sign

02:14:50.124 --> 02:14:52.333
barring me from the
securities industry,

02:14:52.334 --> 02:14:54.436
barring me from Stratton,

02:14:55.421 --> 02:14:56.943
my home.

02:14:59.633 --> 02:15:01.735
What the fuck is that, you know?

02:15:02.845 --> 02:15:05.289
I'll tell you what it is. It's...

02:15:05.889 --> 02:15:08.788
It's me taking no for an answer,
you know.

02:15:10.185 --> 02:15:11.519
It's them...

02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:14.874
It's them selling me,
not the other way around.

02:15:15.524 --> 02:15:18.343
It's me being a hypocrite
is what it is.

02:15:23.407 --> 02:15:24.804
So...

02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:33.483
You know what?

02:15:37.171 --> 02:15:38.838
I'm not leaving.

02:15:41.091 --> 02:15:42.488
I'm not leaving.

02:15:45.304 --> 02:15:46.554
I'm not fucking leaving!

02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:54.038
You're not getting
a fucking promotion!

02:15:55.314 --> 02:15:56.791
The show goes on!

02:15:59.276 --> 02:16:00.777
This is my home!

02:16:00.778 --> 02:16:03.613
They're gonna need
a fucking wrecking ball

02:16:03.614 --> 02:16:05.637
to take me out of here!

02:16:07.534 --> 02:16:10.078
They're gonna need to
send in the National Guard

02:16:10.079 --> 02:16:11.913
or fucking SWAT team

02:16:11.914 --> 02:16:14.517
'cause I ain't going nowhere!

02:16:17.252 --> 02:16:18.353
Fuck them!

02:16:20.756 --> 02:16:22.654
Fuck them!

02:16:56.625 --> 02:16:58.543
Jordy! Jordy!

02:16:58.544 --> 02:17:00.646
Jordy! Get back here!

02:17:01.422 --> 02:17:02.647
Hey!

02:17:05.008 --> 02:17:06.342
Give me that.

02:17:08.804 --> 02:17:09.971
What is this?

02:17:09.972 --> 02:17:12.575
<i>Ramar of the Jungle,
for Christ sake?</i>

02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:16.602
<i>Paddy D, mazel tov, you Irishman.</i>

02:17:16.602 --> 02:17:20.147
<i>Jordan Belfort just welched
on his deal with the SEC.</i>

02:17:20.148 --> 02:17:22.923
<i>He is back in the ocean.
Happy hunting.</i>

02:17:35.706 --> 02:17:38.082
<i>It was our time to party big.</i>

02:17:38.083 --> 02:17:40.811
<i>And just as Brad
was released from jail, too.</i>

02:17:41.545 --> 02:17:43.921
<i>I apologized, even
offered to pay him</i>

02:17:43.922 --> 02:17:45.615
<i>for his time in the can.</i>

02:17:46.133 --> 02:17:48.300
<i>But he said no, that he was out.</i>

02:17:48.302 --> 02:17:50.218
<i>He didn't want any part of us.</i>

02:17:50.219 --> 02:17:51.929
<i>Sad thing was,</i>

02:17:51.930 --> 02:17:53.513
<i>two years later</i>

02:17:53.514 --> 02:17:55.288
<i>he was dead.</i>

02:17:55.350 --> 02:17:57.827
<i>Massive heart attack. Thirty-five.</i>

02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:00.980
<i>Same age Mozart died.</i>

02:18:00.981 --> 02:18:04.316
<i>Not that they have a hell
of a lot in common, but...</i>

02:18:04.317 --> 02:18:06.716
<i>Anyway, I don't know
why that came to mind.</i>

02:18:08.781 --> 02:18:10.031
<i>Within days,</i>

02:18:10.031 --> 02:18:12.492
<i>subpoenas started flying.</i>

02:18:12.493 --> 02:18:15.870
<i>Notices to produce documents,
depositions, you name it.</i>

02:18:15.870 --> 02:18:17.996
<i>Donnie couldn't drink
water fast enough.</i>

02:18:17.998 --> 02:18:20.540
United States government
wants to give me a subpoena?

02:18:20.541 --> 02:18:23.941
Here's what we do with
subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

02:18:29.550 --> 02:18:32.261
Fuck you, USA! Fuck you!

02:18:32.262 --> 02:18:34.222
Fuck you! Fuck you!

02:18:34.223 --> 02:18:36.825
Fuck you!

02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:43.332
Oh!

02:18:43.773 --> 02:18:45.816
Jordan Belfort.

02:18:45.817 --> 02:18:47.902
Alden. That's a nice name.

02:18:47.903 --> 02:18:49.236
Thank you very much for that.

02:18:49.237 --> 02:18:51.531
- What kind of name is that?
- That is my name.

02:18:51.531 --> 02:18:53.241
I do not recall that.

02:18:53.242 --> 02:18:55.700
I do not recall that. Okay?

02:18:55.701 --> 02:18:57.912
Mr. Ming,
thank you for coming in today.

02:18:57.913 --> 02:18:59.621
Are you gonna finish
the rest of that Danish?

02:18:59.623 --> 02:19:00.915
- Can I have that Danish?
- No, no, go ahead.

02:19:00.915 --> 02:19:02.708
<i>They interrogated everybody.</i>

02:19:02.709 --> 02:19:04.418
I got a low blood sugar,
thyroid thing.

02:19:04.419 --> 02:19:05.628
<i>It went on for months.</i>

02:19:05.629 --> 02:19:07.754
<i>It was a total fucking harassment.</i>

02:19:07.755 --> 02:19:09.423
Tell him to proceed
with the questions.

02:19:09.424 --> 02:19:11.925
<i>But not a single
Strattonite cracked.</i>

02:19:11.927 --> 02:19:13.678
Gladys Carrera?

02:19:13.679 --> 02:19:15.304
Doesn't ring a bell.

02:19:15.305 --> 02:19:18.032
Sorry, I have no
recommendation of that.

02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:19.183
No.

02:19:19.183 --> 02:19:20.268
No idea.

02:19:20.269 --> 02:19:22.853
I don't recall that transaction.
You guys have any milk?

02:19:22.855 --> 02:19:25.231
Absolutely not.

02:19:25.232 --> 02:19:27.108
Francis Sortigi
you called so many times

02:19:27.109 --> 02:19:29.442
I just thought you
might remember that.

02:19:29.443 --> 02:19:30.986
<i>Would you remember any of those?</i>

02:19:30.987 --> 02:19:32.822
- I do not recall any of that.
- This Abdul...

02:19:32.823 --> 02:19:35.116
I do not... No, I don't recall.

02:19:35.117 --> 02:19:36.825
It was a long phone call.

02:19:36.826 --> 02:19:38.619
I just wondered
if you have any memory of that.

02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:40.454
Okay. You know we've
talked to several

02:19:40.455 --> 02:19:41.831
of the employees at this firm

02:19:41.832 --> 02:19:43.124
and nobody can recall anything

02:19:43.125 --> 02:19:45.251
about this Steve Madden IPO.

02:19:45.252 --> 02:19:46.568
I think it's Odd.

02:19:48.338 --> 02:19:49.630
Do you recall

02:19:49.631 --> 02:19:50.923
Cartage Corporation?

02:19:50.924 --> 02:19:52.341
Mmm.

02:19:52.342 --> 02:19:53.676
You do recall it?

02:19:53.677 --> 02:19:55.074
No, I don't recall that at all.

02:19:55.554 --> 02:19:58.578
Excuse me. I have to ask.
Is that your real hair?

02:19:59.141 --> 02:20:01.309
Are you gonna say
anything about that?

02:20:01.310 --> 02:20:02.685
Are you gonna comment on my hair?

02:20:02.686 --> 02:20:04.478
Is that how we're doing...
Is this personal questions?

02:20:04.479 --> 02:20:06.272
I'm just wondering why you would
wear something like that.

02:20:06.273 --> 02:20:08.216
Sorry. I don't recall that company.

02:20:10.152 --> 02:20:11.986
Can I get you anything
else, gentlemen?

02:20:11.987 --> 02:20:13.905
Yes. Sweetheart,
I have a rare condition

02:20:13.906 --> 02:20:15.323
which requires me to
drink one of those

02:20:15.324 --> 02:20:17.426
every 15 minutes, please.

02:20:17.826 --> 02:20:20.995
<i>We were specifically advised
not to leave the country.</i>

02:20:20.996 --> 02:20:23.144
<i>So, we took our wives to Italy.</i>

02:20:23.457 --> 02:20:25.917
<i>We figured we were safer
working from overseas</i>

02:20:25.918 --> 02:20:27.376
<i>giving orders to Rugrat.</i>

02:20:27.377 --> 02:20:29.670
<i>Nobody could arrest us
and nobody could prove</i>

02:20:29.671 --> 02:20:31.714
<i>I was still running
Stratton from a yacht.</i>

02:20:31.715 --> 02:20:33.049
Hey, Rugrat.

02:20:33.050 --> 02:20:34.342
- Oh!
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

02:20:34.343 --> 02:20:36.385
You bald-headed eagle,
how you doing?

02:20:36.386 --> 02:20:37.470
<i>Donnie, Donnie, listen!</i>

02:20:37.471 --> 02:20:38.846
We have a problem, okay.

02:20:38.847 --> 02:20:42.183
Your friend, Steve Madden,
is unloading shares.

02:20:42.184 --> 02:20:44.310
What are you saying?
Who told you that?

02:20:44.311 --> 02:20:45.937
<i>- What's going on?
- He's doing it, Donnie!</i>

02:20:45.938 --> 02:20:48.522
He said that
Steve Madden's unloading shares.

02:20:48.523 --> 02:20:49.844
Who told you that? It's bullshit!

02:20:50.192 --> 02:20:52.044
Give me that goddamn phone.

02:20:52.110 --> 02:20:53.803
What's going on?

02:20:53.862 --> 02:20:56.030
Jordan, look.
I'm watching the screen

02:20:56.031 --> 02:20:58.866
and huge chunks of Steve Madden
are being sold, okay.

02:20:58.867 --> 02:21:00.952
It's not coming from us,
so it's gotta be Steve.

02:21:00.953 --> 02:21:03.079
He's the only person
with that many shares.

02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:04.163
It's Donnie.
Call me back, all right.

02:21:04.164 --> 02:21:05.247
Donnie, your little friend

02:21:05.248 --> 02:21:06.582
is trying to fuck
me, you know that.

02:21:06.583 --> 02:21:08.376
Your little friend is trying to
fuck me right in the ass.

02:21:08.377 --> 02:21:10.044
- Get him on the phone now!
- We don't know anything yet.

02:21:10.045 --> 02:21:11.522
Let's not jump to conclusions.

02:21:11.922 --> 02:21:13.714
<i>Even though I owned 85%</i>

02:21:13.715 --> 02:21:16.884
<i>of Steve-cocksucking-
motherfucking-Madden Shoes,</i>

02:21:16.885 --> 02:21:19.220
<i>the shares were in
his fucking name.</i>

02:21:19.221 --> 02:21:21.514
<i>This motherfucker knew
I was in trouble with the feds</i>

02:21:21.515 --> 02:21:23.391
<i>and was trying to take advantage.</i>

02:21:23.392 --> 02:21:24.934
Talk to me, man.
How do you wanna play this?

02:21:24.935 --> 02:21:26.769
I want you to get all our clients
on the phone right now

02:21:26.770 --> 02:21:28.187
and have them start
selling Steve Madden.

02:21:28.188 --> 02:21:29.730
We're gonna drive
that fucking price down!

02:21:29.731 --> 02:21:31.565
Do you hear me? Shut the fuck up!

02:21:31.566 --> 02:21:33.109
This is your fucking friend
from high school.

02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:35.277
<i>If that little fucking prick thinks
he can fuck with me,</i>

02:21:35.278 --> 02:21:37.947
we'll turn his company
into a penny stock! You hear me?

02:21:37.948 --> 02:21:39.448
- You got it?
- Yes. I got it!

02:21:39.449 --> 02:21:40.992
<i>Let's just not
jump to conclusions</i>

02:21:40.993 --> 02:21:42.451
<i>before we know what's going on.</i>

02:21:42.452 --> 02:21:43.911
Captain Ted!

02:21:43.912 --> 02:21:45.104
Captain Ted!

02:21:45.497 --> 02:21:47.957
Hang up your phones!
Everybody, hey!

02:21:47.958 --> 02:21:50.857
Turn the boat around!
We're going home!

02:21:53.839 --> 02:21:56.362
Baby! Baby, what happened?

02:21:56.508 --> 02:21:57.860
I just...

02:21:58.176 --> 02:21:59.528
Sweetheart, what's going on?

02:22:00.595 --> 02:22:02.288
Aunt Emma...

02:22:03.098 --> 02:22:04.495
Just wait.

02:22:04.766 --> 02:22:06.475
I can't...

02:22:06.476 --> 02:22:09.437
What's going on? Why you crying?

02:22:09.438 --> 02:22:11.605
- She's dead!
- Who? Who's dead?

02:22:11.606 --> 02:22:14.066
I just got a call
from my cousin Betty.

02:22:14.067 --> 02:22:15.234
Yeah?

02:22:15.235 --> 02:22:17.053
Aunt Emma is dead.

02:22:18.321 --> 02:22:21.140
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

02:22:21.408 --> 02:22:22.634
You're serious?

02:22:23.326 --> 02:22:25.745
Oh, my God! Baby, that's...

02:22:25.746 --> 02:22:27.288
Oh, fuck!

02:22:27.289 --> 02:22:29.123
Oh, sweetheart, that's just...

02:22:29.124 --> 02:22:30.541
<i>Fucking heart attack!</i>

02:22:30.542 --> 02:22:32.209
<i>Boom, snap, gone.</i>

02:22:32.210 --> 02:22:34.128
<i>Shuffled off her mortal coil.</i>

02:22:34.129 --> 02:22:37.590
<i>And $20 million stuck
in a Swiss bank account.</i>

02:22:37.591 --> 02:22:39.759
The last time I talked to her
she was fine!

02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:41.969
- She's not that old.
- Oh, God! Baby, oh, God!

02:22:41.970 --> 02:22:44.221
That's so fucking terrible!

02:22:44.222 --> 02:22:46.015
Oh, fuck!

02:22:46.016 --> 02:22:47.141
It is terrible.

02:22:47.142 --> 02:22:49.727
Your aunt was such an elegant,
attractive woman.

02:22:49.728 --> 02:22:51.562
My condolences to you
and your family.

02:22:51.563 --> 02:22:53.147
Yes. We're absolutely devastated.

02:22:53.148 --> 02:22:55.274
Thank you so much
for your condolences.

02:22:55.275 --> 02:22:56.567
Now where does that leave us

02:22:56.568 --> 02:22:58.235
in regard to her account exactly?

02:22:58.236 --> 02:22:59.820
Does it go into probate or what?

02:22:59.821 --> 02:23:01.489
Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.

02:23:01.490 --> 02:23:03.282
Your aunt, before she died,

02:23:03.283 --> 02:23:06.262
signed a document naming you
as her successor.

02:23:06.453 --> 02:23:07.995
She did?

02:23:07.996 --> 02:23:09.769
Fantastic! Well, that's good news!

02:23:09.956 --> 02:23:12.229
Well, not as of yet.

02:23:12.417 --> 02:23:14.502
What does that mean? Not as of yet?

02:23:16.838 --> 02:23:18.672
I can't seem to hear you.

02:23:18.673 --> 02:23:21.447
I must have bad reception.
Are you speaking English?

02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:24.303
- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast.
<i>- Fast?</i>

02:23:24.304 --> 02:23:26.472
I have to get to Switzerland now?

02:23:28.100 --> 02:23:30.267
Speak English!
Fucking speak English!

02:23:30.268 --> 02:23:31.685
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey.
Hey! Quiet, okay?

02:23:31.686 --> 02:23:33.187
Take your suit,
take your dick, okay,

02:23:33.188 --> 02:23:34.980
- and move your ass! Please.
- Okay.

02:23:34.981 --> 02:23:37.066
Move my ass! Yes!

02:23:37.067 --> 02:23:41.278
<i>I gotta say, these Swiss were
some sneaky motherfuckers.</i>

02:23:41.279 --> 02:23:43.322
<i>Within minutes,
he had me set up with a forger</i>

02:23:43.323 --> 02:23:45.366
<i>who could fake Aunt
Emma's signature.</i>

02:23:45.367 --> 02:23:47.014
You American shit!

02:23:47.077 --> 02:23:48.911
<i>I just had to get
there by tomorrow,</i>

02:23:48.912 --> 02:23:50.538
<i>or lose $20 million.</i>

02:23:50.539 --> 02:23:52.357
We're going to Monaco!

02:23:52.833 --> 02:23:55.209
- Monaco? Now?
- Yes, baby.

02:23:55.210 --> 02:23:57.878
We're going to Monaco, so then
we can go to Switzerland, okay?

02:23:57.879 --> 02:23:59.652
- But her aunt just died.
- I realize that.

02:23:59.673 --> 02:24:00.923
But I have business in Switzerland.

02:24:00.924 --> 02:24:02.633
I need to go to
Switzerland right now.

02:24:02.634 --> 02:24:04.828
Bottom line. Sorry.

02:24:05.053 --> 02:24:06.905
We gotta get to London.

02:24:07.347 --> 02:24:08.664
Why? Why?

02:24:10.058 --> 02:24:11.350
The funeral!

02:24:11.351 --> 02:24:12.794
Yeah, but babe. Look, look...

02:24:13.145 --> 02:24:15.980
I loved your aunt more than
anyone in the entire world.

02:24:15.981 --> 02:24:17.628
I really did.

02:24:18.024 --> 02:24:20.317
But she's dead now, sweetie.

02:24:20.318 --> 02:24:22.611
She's dead
and she's not going anywhere.

02:24:22.612 --> 02:24:23.904
She'll still be dead by the time

02:24:23.905 --> 02:24:25.131
we get to London, okay?

02:24:25.657 --> 02:24:27.491
Captain Ted! Captain
Ted, all right, look.

02:24:27.492 --> 02:24:29.410
We're going to Monaco.
Monaco now, okay?

02:24:29.411 --> 02:24:30.494
Monaco, right.

02:24:30.495 --> 02:24:32.454
We're going to Monaco
so that we can drive to Switzerland

02:24:32.455 --> 02:24:33.873
so they don't stamp our passports.

02:24:33.874 --> 02:24:35.791
Take care of business here,
we'll drive back to Monaco,

02:24:35.792 --> 02:24:37.585
take a flight over to London
to catch the funeral

02:24:37.586 --> 02:24:39.128
and be in New York
in three fucking business days!

02:24:39.129 --> 02:24:40.421
That's the fucking plan.

02:24:40.422 --> 02:24:42.882
I just want you to know
that we might run into some chop.

02:24:42.883 --> 02:24:45.134
Chop?
We can fucking handle chop, right?

02:24:45.135 --> 02:24:46.635
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.

02:24:46.636 --> 02:24:48.053
No, no, no. We're
not going anywhere

02:24:48.054 --> 02:24:49.430
unless he says it's
safe, all right.

02:24:49.431 --> 02:24:50.973
- Don't worry about the chop.
- It's safe.

02:24:50.974 --> 02:24:52.433
You don't know shit about chop.

02:24:52.434 --> 02:24:54.685
Oh, really? And you do?
You're a fucking expert on that.

02:24:54.686 --> 02:24:57.104
I'll chop your fucking credit
card in half. How about that?

02:24:57.105 --> 02:24:59.106
Chop is fine. Trust me.
Chop is fine.

02:24:59.107 --> 02:25:00.858
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?

02:25:00.859 --> 02:25:02.109
Uh...

02:25:02.110 --> 02:25:04.069
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.

02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:05.279
Yeah, we're gonna take it slow.

02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:06.947
It's a little uncomfortable.
Tell them it's safe.

02:25:06.948 --> 02:25:08.240
It's gonna be safe.

02:25:08.241 --> 02:25:10.451
We'll batten down the hatches

02:25:10.452 --> 02:25:11.911
and secure the deck.

02:25:11.912 --> 02:25:15.456
And we're looking at a few...
Maybe a few broken dishes.

02:25:15.457 --> 02:25:16.916
Few broken dishes.

02:25:16.917 --> 02:25:18.167
What's a few broken dishes?

02:25:18.168 --> 02:25:19.543
Does that sound fucking
awesome or what?

02:25:19.544 --> 02:25:21.003
No. Not really.

02:25:21.004 --> 02:25:22.379
We're gonna have a
fucking good time!

02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:24.215
Let's go to fucking Monaco now!

02:25:24.216 --> 02:25:25.408
Let's fucking move! Let's go!

02:25:30.805 --> 02:25:31.952
Hold On!

02:25:35.018 --> 02:25:38.145
What the fuck is going on out here?

02:25:38.146 --> 02:25:40.814
The Jet Skis just went overboard!

02:25:40.815 --> 02:25:42.942
Oh, Jesus Christ! Honey, you okay?

02:25:42.943 --> 02:25:45.152
<i>Gale warning! Gale warning!</i>

02:25:45.153 --> 02:25:47.988
The waves are
20 feet high and building!

02:25:47.989 --> 02:25:49.782
Turn around, let's go
the other fucking way.

02:25:49.783 --> 02:25:51.033
- We can't!
- Go!

02:25:51.034 --> 02:25:53.702
We'll get broad-sided.
It'll tip over!

02:25:53.703 --> 02:25:55.621
I am a master diver. You hear that?

02:25:55.622 --> 02:25:56.705
I'm a master diver!

02:25:56.706 --> 02:25:58.040
No one's gonna fucking die!

02:25:58.041 --> 02:26:00.751
I got you, baby. I got you.
Trust me, okay?

02:26:00.752 --> 02:26:02.127
I love you.

02:26:02.128 --> 02:26:04.129
I love you, baby.
Just hold on tight.

02:26:04.130 --> 02:26:05.214
Okay.

02:26:05.215 --> 02:26:06.362
Donnie!

02:26:07.842 --> 02:26:09.176
Hold on, baby!

02:26:09.177 --> 02:26:10.278
Donnie!

02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:13.327
Donnie!

02:26:13.723 --> 02:26:15.182
- What?
- Hold on, baby.

02:26:15.183 --> 02:26:16.809
Get the fucking ludes.

02:26:16.810 --> 02:26:18.018
I don't wanna die, Jordan!

02:26:18.019 --> 02:26:20.838
I did a lot of bad shit.
I'm going to hell, Jordan!

02:26:20.855 --> 02:26:23.816
I fucked up! I fucked up so bad!

02:26:23.817 --> 02:26:25.885
Get the ludes! Downstairs!

02:26:26.027 --> 02:26:27.299
What are you saying?

02:26:27.696 --> 02:26:29.264
Fuck!

02:26:30.031 --> 02:26:31.282
Get the ludes!

02:26:31.283 --> 02:26:32.992
I can't go down there, Jordan.
It's flooded.

02:26:32.993 --> 02:26:34.326
It's three feet of
water down there!

02:26:34.327 --> 02:26:37.162
I will not die sober!

02:26:37.163 --> 02:26:38.998
Get those fucking ludes!

02:26:38.999 --> 02:26:40.082
Okay!

02:26:40.083 --> 02:26:41.526
- Go!
- Okay

02:26:44.296 --> 02:26:46.130
- Where's he going?
- Hold on, baby!

02:26:46.131 --> 02:26:47.840
Donnie! Is he fucking crazy?

02:26:47.841 --> 02:26:49.281
He's just warning everybody!

02:27:01.146 --> 02:27:02.998
Jesus Christ!

02:27:04.441 --> 02:27:05.733
Hold on!

02:27:05.734 --> 02:27:07.234
Get away from the window!

02:27:07.235 --> 02:27:08.736
Rogue wave!

02:27:08.737 --> 02:27:09.862
Mayday!

02:27:09.863 --> 02:27:12.531
This is Captain Ted Beecham
aboard the yacht Naomi!

02:27:12.532 --> 02:27:14.134
- We are going down!
- I got 'em!

02:27:14.451 --> 02:27:15.803
I got 'em!

02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:18.454
Give me one for the nerves!

02:27:18.455 --> 02:27:19.705
We're going down!

02:27:19.706 --> 02:27:21.957
This is a fucking Mayday!

02:27:21.958 --> 02:27:24.186
We require immediate assistance!

02:27:25.754 --> 02:27:27.379
Hold on!

02:27:27.380 --> 02:27:28.481
Watch out!

02:27:40.268 --> 02:27:42.917
<i>The nice thing about
getting rescued by Italians</i>

02:27:43.104 --> 02:27:46.774
<i>is that they feed you,
make you drink red wine,</i>

02:27:46.775 --> 02:27:48.843
<i>then you get to dance.</i>

02:28:05.293 --> 02:28:07.066
<i>Did you see that?</i>

02:28:07.379 --> 02:28:10.403
<i>That was the plane
I sent to come get us.</i>

02:28:11.216 --> 02:28:12.883
<i>I shit you not, it exploded</i>

02:28:12.884 --> 02:28:15.052
<i>when a seagull flew
into the engine.</i>

02:28:15.053 --> 02:28:17.155
<i>Three people killed.</i>

02:28:21.267 --> 02:28:23.143
<i>You want a sign from God?</i>

02:28:23.144 --> 02:28:26.373
<i>Well, after all this,
I finally got the message.</i>

02:28:31.694 --> 02:28:35.447
<i>Do you dream of becoming
financially independent</i>

02:28:35.448 --> 02:28:38.158
but struggle every month
just to pay your bills?

02:28:38.159 --> 02:28:40.119
Would you like to own
a home like this,

02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:42.329
but can barely afford
to pay your rent?

02:28:42.330 --> 02:28:44.039
My name is Jordan Belfort,

02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:46.166
and there's no secret
to wealth creation.

02:28:46.167 --> 02:28:47.501
No matter who you are,

02:28:47.502 --> 02:28:48.836
no matter where you came from,

02:28:48.837 --> 02:28:51.380
you too can become
financially independent

02:28:51.381 --> 02:28:53.215
in just a matter of months.

02:28:53.216 --> 02:28:55.467
All you need is a strategy.

02:28:55.468 --> 02:28:57.177
When I was 24 years old,

02:28:57.178 --> 02:29:01.056
I made a decision not just
to survive, but to thrive.

02:29:01.057 --> 02:29:03.600
<i>At first I didn't feel like
deals like these were possible.</i>

02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:07.146
But we have the house
and we have a $33,000 profit.

02:29:07.147 --> 02:29:08.355
I certainly believe now.

02:29:08.356 --> 02:29:09.857
Think about it for a second.

02:29:09.858 --> 02:29:12.025
If you don't have the guts
to attend Jordan Belfort's

02:29:12.026 --> 02:29:14.278
Straight Line Persuasion
System seminar,

02:29:14.279 --> 02:29:15.946
then how do you expect
to make any money?

02:29:15.947 --> 02:29:17.698
<i>If you want to be
a millionaire someday,</i>

02:29:17.699 --> 02:29:19.783
<i>have some guts. Make a decision.</i>

02:29:19.784 --> 02:29:21.118
Jordan Belfort's
setup worked for me

02:29:21.119 --> 02:29:22.619
because I worked hard for it.

02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:24.163
And if it doesn't work for you,

02:29:24.164 --> 02:29:25.247
it's because you're lazy.

02:29:25.248 --> 02:29:26.540
And you should get a
job at McDonald's.

02:29:26.541 --> 02:29:29.501
<i>There's nobody holding
you back from financial freedom.</i>

02:29:29.502 --> 02:29:32.463
And there's nobody stopping
you from making millions.

02:29:32.464 --> 02:29:33.797
Don't just sit at home,

02:29:33.798 --> 02:29:36.526
or the life of your dreams
will sail right past you.

02:29:39.220 --> 02:29:41.180
I changed all these people's lives

02:29:41.181 --> 02:29:42.890
and I can change yours, too!

02:29:42.891 --> 02:29:44.224
So come to my seminar!

02:29:44.225 --> 02:29:45.726
The life of your dreams is only...

02:29:45.727 --> 02:29:47.519
Good to see you again, Jordan.

02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:48.645
You're under arrest!

02:29:48.646 --> 02:29:50.339
You gotta be joking!

02:29:51.524 --> 02:29:52.816
You're kidding me.

02:29:52.817 --> 02:29:54.485
Hey, get the fuck away from me!

02:29:54.486 --> 02:29:55.819
Turn that camera off.

02:29:55.820 --> 02:29:57.905
I'm fucking shooting a
fucking infomercial here,

02:29:57.906 --> 02:29:59.406
you fucking cocksucker!

02:29:59.407 --> 02:30:01.158
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
- Shut the fucking camera off.

02:30:01.159 --> 02:30:03.035
You don't got shit
on me, you hear me!

02:30:03.036 --> 02:30:04.161
Go fuck yourself!

02:30:04.162 --> 02:30:06.622
I'm making an honest living,
you fucking piece of shit!

02:30:06.623 --> 02:30:07.748
Hey, Jordan,

02:30:07.749 --> 02:30:09.708
let me give you a
little legal advice.

02:30:09.709 --> 02:30:11.210
Shut the fuck up!

02:30:11.211 --> 02:30:12.794
Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick!

02:30:12.795 --> 02:30:15.489
I'm making an honest living,
you motherfucker!

02:30:17.175 --> 02:30:18.717
<i>I clean up my act.</i>

02:30:18.718 --> 02:30:21.345
<i>I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.</i>

02:30:21.346 --> 02:30:24.181
<i>I'm sober for two years.
And this happens!</i>

02:30:24.182 --> 02:30:26.475
<i>Rugrat goes and gets busted
down in Miami.</i>

02:30:26.476 --> 02:30:27.809
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.

02:30:27.810 --> 02:30:29.603
<i>And guess who
the fuck with? Saurel.</i>

02:30:29.604 --> 02:30:30.729
- You gonna beat me?
- No, sir.

02:30:30.730 --> 02:30:33.065
Yeah, I know your country.
You're gonna beat me.

02:30:33.066 --> 02:30:34.858
<i>I mean, what are
the fucking odds?</i>

02:30:34.859 --> 02:30:37.611
<i>There had to be 10,000
Swiss bankers in Geneva,</i>

02:30:37.612 --> 02:30:39.279
<i>and Rugrat gets the
one dumb enough</i>

02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:41.448
<i>to get himself arrested
on U. S. soil.</i>

02:30:41.449 --> 02:30:42.926
I know.

02:30:42.951 --> 02:30:44.428
I'm so sorry.

02:30:46.538 --> 02:30:47.829
<i>Even more fucked</i>

02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:49.289
<i>- was that he got busted</i>

02:30:49.290 --> 02:30:51.041
<i>for shit that had
nothing to do with me.</i>

02:30:51.042 --> 02:30:52.709
<i>It had nothing to
fucking do with me.</i>

02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:54.795
<i>Something about
laundering drug money</i>

02:30:54.796 --> 02:30:57.965
<i>through offshore boat racing
and a guy named Rocky Aoki,</i>

02:30:57.966 --> 02:31:00.133
<i>you know, the founder of Benihana.</i>

02:31:00.134 --> 02:31:01.593
<i>Benihana.</i>

02:31:01.594 --> 02:31:03.367
<i>Beni-fucking-hana!</i>

02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:05.514
<i>Beni-fucking-hana!</i>

02:31:05.515 --> 02:31:06.598
<i>Why?</i>

02:31:06.599 --> 02:31:08.016
<i>Why, why, God?</i>

02:31:08.017 --> 02:31:09.601
<i>Why would you be so cruel</i>

02:31:09.602 --> 02:31:12.229
<i>as to choose a chain
of fucking hibachi restaurants</i>

02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:13.582
<i>to take me down?</i>

02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:18.485
<i>Long story short.
Saurel rats me out.</i>

02:31:18.486 --> 02:31:21.655
<i>But not before he rats out
Brad's wife, Chantalle,</i>

02:31:21.656 --> 02:31:23.323
<i>who, it turns out,
he'd been fucking</i>

02:31:23.324 --> 02:31:25.893
<i>every time she went to Switzerland!</i>

02:31:27.745 --> 02:31:30.394
- No, no, no, it's impossible.
- Oui, oui, oui.

02:31:32.500 --> 02:31:34.334
- All right!
- Ah!

02:31:34.335 --> 02:31:36.169
<i>One count engaging in conspiracy</i>

02:31:36.170 --> 02:31:37.921
<i>to commit securities fraud.</i>

02:31:37.922 --> 02:31:40.215
<i>Two counts securities fraud.</i>

02:31:40.216 --> 02:31:43.760
One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit money laundering.

02:31:43.761 --> 02:31:46.096
Twenty-one counts money laundering.

02:31:46.097 --> 02:31:48.620
One count obstruction of justice.

02:31:49.517 --> 02:31:51.836
Bail is set at $10 million.

02:32:06.993 --> 02:32:08.561
<i>Uncle Donnie's here!</i>

02:32:09.370 --> 02:32:11.689
Rocky. How you doing?

02:32:12.290 --> 02:32:14.666
Woof. I hate that fucking dog.

02:32:14.667 --> 02:32:17.044
Yeah, he's getting
old and decrepit.

02:32:17.045 --> 02:32:18.629
Starting to shit in
the house again.

02:32:18.630 --> 02:32:20.422
- Me, too.
- Come here, buddy.

02:32:20.423 --> 02:32:21.798
Ah, fuck.

02:32:21.799 --> 02:32:23.550
- It's good to see you, pal.
- Yeah, you, too.

02:32:23.551 --> 02:32:24.801
Good to see you.

02:32:24.802 --> 02:32:27.451
Sit down. Oh, man.

02:32:29.223 --> 02:32:30.575
How you doing, brother?

02:32:31.309 --> 02:32:32.893
You know.

02:32:32.894 --> 02:32:34.645
Shitty, pal.

02:32:34.646 --> 02:32:36.874
But I'm hanging in there.

02:32:38.107 --> 02:32:40.734
My new piece of jewelry.
Check that out.

02:32:40.735 --> 02:32:43.195
Can't leave the house, you know?

02:32:43.196 --> 02:32:45.845
Starting to get cabin
fever already.

02:32:46.324 --> 02:32:48.017
Fucking Rugrat.

02:32:48.451 --> 02:32:49.868
That wig-wearing faggot.

02:32:49.869 --> 02:32:52.079
I can't believe that fucking guy.
I wanna kill him.

02:32:52.080 --> 02:32:54.748
Swear to God,
I want to choke him to death.

02:32:54.749 --> 02:32:57.084
Irresponsible little prick.

02:32:58.211 --> 02:32:59.358
I'll tell you one thing.

02:33:00.588 --> 02:33:03.191
I'm never eating at Benihana again.

02:33:03.925 --> 02:33:06.198
I don't care whose birthday it is.

02:33:07.512 --> 02:33:09.205
Where's Naomi? How's she doing?

02:33:09.889 --> 02:33:11.264
That's her in the house there.

02:33:11.265 --> 02:33:13.333
You could say hi, but she
probably won't wave back.

02:33:13.434 --> 02:33:15.207
Naomi, sweetheart!

02:33:18.564 --> 02:33:19.898
What's up her ass?

02:33:19.899 --> 02:33:21.483
- Is she mad at me?
- No, you know...

02:33:21.484 --> 02:33:23.068
We probably have to
mortgage the house

02:33:23.069 --> 02:33:24.945
in order to make bail.

02:33:24.946 --> 02:33:26.446
Probably end up selling the thing

02:33:26.447 --> 02:33:28.699
in order to pay for
all the lawyers.

02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:31.269
It's been a nightmare, buddy,
to tell you the truth.

02:33:31.452 --> 02:33:33.225
What are you gonna do, right?

02:33:33.955 --> 02:33:36.832
Anyway, how's Stratton?
That's more important.

02:33:36.833 --> 02:33:37.999
How's morale?

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.752
They all pissed off 'cause they
have to make money legally now?

02:33:40.753 --> 02:33:42.275
- Jordan.
- Hmm?

02:33:42.547 --> 02:33:45.090
I got the founding
partners together.

02:33:45.091 --> 02:33:47.569
I talked to them about everything.

02:33:48.219 --> 02:33:49.366
And I got you.

02:33:50.096 --> 02:33:51.743
What do you mean, you got me?

02:33:52.807 --> 02:33:55.626
The house, money, don't
worry about it. I got you.

02:34:01.524 --> 02:34:02.691
All right.

02:34:02.692 --> 02:34:03.775
I love you, buddy.

02:34:03.776 --> 02:34:05.777
- You know I'd do it for you, right?
- I know.

02:34:05.778 --> 02:34:07.846
- You know that, right?
- I know.

02:34:08.698 --> 02:34:09.948
I could fucking kiss you all over.

02:34:09.949 --> 02:34:11.158
All right, enough, enough.

02:34:13.161 --> 02:34:14.411
You want a beer, pal?

02:34:14.412 --> 02:34:15.704
What are you drinking?

02:34:15.705 --> 02:34:17.873
I got this non-alcoholic shit.

02:34:17.874 --> 02:34:19.166
What's that?

02:34:19.167 --> 02:34:22.294
A non-alcoholic beer.
It's got no alcohol.

02:34:22.295 --> 02:34:24.648
- It's a beer?
- Yeah, with no alcohol.

02:34:25.131 --> 02:34:26.465
But if you drink enough,

02:34:26.466 --> 02:34:28.467
if you drink a lot,
they get you fucked up?

02:34:28.468 --> 02:34:30.635
No, there's no alcohol.
That's the fucking point.

02:34:30.636 --> 02:34:31.762
I'm not a scientist.

02:34:31.763 --> 02:34:33.013
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

02:34:33.014 --> 02:34:34.681
I can get you a beer
if you want a fucking beer.

02:34:34.682 --> 02:34:36.933
I know, but I don't drink.
You remember?

02:34:36.934 --> 02:34:38.185
I don't drink anymore.

02:34:38.186 --> 02:34:39.269
Oh, you wanna go inside

02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:40.771
and blow some lines
of baking powder?

02:34:40.772 --> 02:34:42.689
Or baking soda...

02:34:42.690 --> 02:34:45.066
Can't imagine ever not
enjoying getting fucked up.

02:34:45.067 --> 02:34:46.610
- Yeah.
- I love it.

02:34:46.611 --> 02:34:48.195
How's being sober?

02:34:48.196 --> 02:34:50.155
- Fucking sucks.
- Boring, right?

02:34:50.156 --> 02:34:52.634
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

02:34:53.075 --> 02:34:55.702
There's a term,
and we don't like to use it

02:34:55.703 --> 02:34:57.245
unless circumstances dictate,

02:34:57.246 --> 02:34:59.331
and I think they do
dictate in this case,

02:34:59.332 --> 02:35:00.832
and the term is "Grenada."

02:35:00.833 --> 02:35:02.417
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

02:35:02.418 --> 02:35:03.585
No. No, I haven't.

02:35:03.586 --> 02:35:05.212
Grenada's very interesting because

02:35:05.213 --> 02:35:07.214
it is a small island nation

02:35:07.215 --> 02:35:10.842
that was invaded by the United
States of America in 1983.

02:35:10.843 --> 02:35:13.011
It's about 90,000 people.

02:35:13.012 --> 02:35:15.331
And essentially, it means

02:35:16.015 --> 02:35:18.058
this case is unloseable.

02:35:18.059 --> 02:35:19.226
Okay?

02:35:19.227 --> 02:35:20.894
So, you know, we can come in,

02:35:20.895 --> 02:35:22.854
we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants.

02:35:22.855 --> 02:35:24.064
Nobody gives a fuck.

02:35:24.065 --> 02:35:25.758
I'm gonna win.

02:35:25.817 --> 02:35:27.294
You, sir.

02:35:28.736 --> 02:35:30.554
Are what's known

02:35:31.489 --> 02:35:32.739
as a Grenada.

02:35:32.740 --> 02:35:33.932
Hmm.

02:35:35.785 --> 02:35:38.245
You're looking at real prison time.

02:35:38.246 --> 02:35:39.329
Hmm.

02:35:39.330 --> 02:35:41.728
Money laundering can get you
as much as 20 years.

02:35:42.625 --> 02:35:45.418
And our case couldn't be stronger
if we caught you

02:35:45.419 --> 02:35:47.170
shoving cash in your mattress.

02:35:47.171 --> 02:35:48.318
Is that right?

02:35:49.090 --> 02:35:51.613
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.

02:35:52.218 --> 02:35:56.096
Your rotting away in jail
till your kids get out of college,

02:35:56.097 --> 02:35:57.870
that's not our ambition here.

02:35:59.141 --> 02:36:01.768
There's other people
involved in this, too.

02:36:01.769 --> 02:36:05.043
We think they need to
see their day in court as well.

02:36:07.525 --> 02:36:09.609
Why do I sense
there's an offer in the air?

02:36:09.610 --> 02:36:12.384
Look at him. He's got a sense.
What are you, Kreskin?

02:36:13.489 --> 02:36:16.366
Full cooperation. He provides
us with a comprehensive list

02:36:16.367 --> 02:36:18.785
of all the co-conspirators
spanning the last seven years,

02:36:18.786 --> 02:36:20.871
and he also agrees to wear a wire.

02:36:20.872 --> 02:36:22.205
Wait...

02:36:22.206 --> 02:36:24.040
Did you just say "wear a wire"?

02:36:24.041 --> 02:36:25.375
A wire. Mmm-hmm.

02:36:25.376 --> 02:36:26.793
What does that mean?

02:36:26.794 --> 02:36:28.753
You want me to rat? Is that it?

02:36:28.754 --> 02:36:30.130
No, I want you to cooperate.

02:36:30.131 --> 02:36:32.132
- No. You want me to rat, right?
- Yes. We want you to rat.

02:36:32.133 --> 02:36:35.658
That's fucking exactly
what we want you to do. To rat.

02:36:40.057 --> 02:36:41.975
How was Cristy's party?

02:36:41.976 --> 02:36:43.143
Fine.

02:36:43.144 --> 02:36:44.587
Good.

02:36:45.646 --> 02:36:48.189
Babe, I spoke to the
lawyers again today.

02:36:48.190 --> 02:36:50.942
I have some really,
really great news.

02:36:50.943 --> 02:36:52.386
Mmm-hmm.

02:36:52.695 --> 02:36:55.389
Turns out you're completely
off the hook, honey.

02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:57.991
I know that already.

02:36:57.992 --> 02:36:59.389
Right. Exactly.

02:36:59.702 --> 02:37:03.022
You never did anything wrong
in the first place, right?

02:37:03.748 --> 02:37:06.067
It turns out, all the FBI really

02:37:06.626 --> 02:37:08.603
wants from me is to, uh,

02:37:08.794 --> 02:37:10.396
to cooperate.

02:37:10.504 --> 02:37:11.838
You know?

02:37:11.839 --> 02:37:13.214
Turns out I have so
much information

02:37:13.215 --> 02:37:14.883
about the stock market
and Wall Street,

02:37:14.884 --> 02:37:16.092
I could save the government

02:37:16.093 --> 02:37:18.094
years of heartache, not to mention

02:37:18.095 --> 02:37:20.573
- countless dollars.
- Mmm-hmm.

02:37:20.890 --> 02:37:23.334
But it gets even better, babe.

02:37:23.684 --> 02:37:26.333
Because if I do
decide to cooperate,

02:37:26.646 --> 02:37:29.522
I might only be
looking at four short years,

02:37:29.523 --> 02:37:31.107
in which case, you know,

02:37:31.108 --> 02:37:34.194
we could start fresh,
maybe sell the house.

02:37:34.195 --> 02:37:35.946
And any fines that I'd have to pay

02:37:35.947 --> 02:37:37.822
wouldn't be due till
after I serve my term,

02:37:37.823 --> 02:37:40.200
so we'd still have plenty of
money left over, you know?

02:37:40.201 --> 02:37:41.723
Mmm-hmm.

02:37:42.745 --> 02:37:45.246
The only thing that of course
bummed me out a little bit

02:37:45.247 --> 02:37:47.600
is this whole idea of having to

02:37:48.125 --> 02:37:50.377
give information about my friends.

02:37:50.378 --> 02:37:53.713
Like you said, "There's no friends
on Wall Street." Right?

02:37:53.714 --> 02:37:55.715
Right. Right. Exactly.

02:37:55.716 --> 02:37:57.384
There's a silver lining
to that, too, honey.

02:37:57.385 --> 02:37:59.177
Because they said eventually...

02:37:59.178 --> 02:38:02.138
Eventually everyone's gonna have to
give information on this case.

02:38:02.139 --> 02:38:05.016
So, at the end of the day, it might
not even be a factor. You know?

02:38:05.017 --> 02:38:07.227
Well, that's good news. Right?

02:38:07.228 --> 02:38:09.062
Yeah, yeah.

02:38:09.063 --> 02:38:10.836
I'm really happy for you.

02:38:12.149 --> 02:38:15.503
What do you mean, happy for me,
sweetheart?

02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:18.989
You should be happy for
the both of us. Right?

02:38:18.990 --> 02:38:21.013
- Yeah, right.
- All right.

02:38:23.035 --> 02:38:24.728
Come here, baby.

02:38:25.162 --> 02:38:26.746
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.

02:38:26.747 --> 02:38:27.872
Jordan...

02:38:27.873 --> 02:38:29.124
Oh, come on, baby.

02:38:29.125 --> 02:38:31.418
I haven't made love to
you in so long. Please.

02:38:31.419 --> 02:38:33.920
- No. Jordan, stop it.
- Come on, honey, please.

02:38:33.921 --> 02:38:35.489
No! Jordan, stop it!

02:38:37.091 --> 02:38:39.410
I've loved you
since the moment I saw you.

02:38:43.222 --> 02:38:45.199
I fucking hate you, Jordan.

02:38:45.683 --> 02:38:48.332
- Get off me!
- Baby... Don't do that.

02:38:49.103 --> 02:38:51.126
You know how much I
love you, right?

02:38:51.522 --> 02:38:53.795
Stop that, sweetie. Please.

02:38:58.946 --> 02:39:01.048
You wanna fuck me, Jordan?

02:39:02.742 --> 02:39:04.560
You wanna fuck me?

02:39:05.453 --> 02:39:06.619
Good.

02:39:06.620 --> 02:39:08.063
Go ahead.

02:39:08.456 --> 02:39:10.524
Go ahead and fuck me.

02:39:11.459 --> 02:39:14.002
I want you to fuck me real hard.

02:39:14.003 --> 02:39:16.796
I want you to fuck me
like it's the last fucking time.

02:39:16.797 --> 02:39:18.173
- Why are you moving like that?
- Come on.

02:39:18.174 --> 02:39:19.257
Please hold still.

02:39:19.258 --> 02:39:20.884
'Cause I want you to
come for me, baby.

02:39:20.885 --> 02:39:22.302
Come on, babe.

02:39:22.303 --> 02:39:23.845
Come for me, baby.

02:39:23.846 --> 02:39:25.138
I want you to come for me

02:39:25.139 --> 02:39:26.723
like it's the last fucking time.

02:39:26.724 --> 02:39:28.266
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:39:28.267 --> 02:39:30.935
Come on, baby. Come for me.
Come for me, baby.

02:39:30.936 --> 02:39:32.145
Come on, baby.

02:39:32.146 --> 02:39:33.521
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:39:33.522 --> 02:39:35.565
- Yeah, baby, come.
- You want me to come for you?

02:39:35.566 --> 02:39:36.838
Yeah.

02:39:37.568 --> 02:39:39.611
- You want me to come for you?
- Yeah!

02:39:39.612 --> 02:39:42.056
Huh? You want me to come for you?

02:39:43.783 --> 02:39:45.575
Oh, God, baby. Yeah!

02:39:45.576 --> 02:39:48.179
Oh, God. Oh, God.

02:39:49.371 --> 02:39:51.815
Oh, God.

02:39:52.374 --> 02:39:53.917
Oh, God.

02:39:53.918 --> 02:39:55.270
Jesus.

02:39:58.798 --> 02:40:00.173
Oh, baby.

02:40:00.174 --> 02:40:02.801
That was so fucking great!

02:40:02.802 --> 02:40:04.154
Oh, God!

02:40:06.430 --> 02:40:08.453
That was the last time.

02:40:08.849 --> 02:40:10.892
What do you mean, baby?

02:40:10.893 --> 02:40:13.963
I mean that was the last time
we ever have sex.

02:40:14.855 --> 02:40:17.049
What are you talking about?

02:40:18.943 --> 02:40:20.670
I want a divorce.

02:40:22.196 --> 02:40:24.239
What do you mean,
you want a divorce?

02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:26.366
What's that supposed to mean,
you want a divorce?

02:40:26.367 --> 02:40:28.390
Get off me! I want a divorce.

02:40:28.619 --> 02:40:29.953
You just made love to me.

02:40:29.954 --> 02:40:31.121
What the fuck is wrong with you?

02:40:31.122 --> 02:40:33.566
I don't love you anymore, Jordan!

02:40:34.708 --> 02:40:36.810
Oh, you don't love me?

02:40:37.086 --> 02:40:38.795
You don't love me anymore, huh?

02:40:38.796 --> 02:40:41.089
Well, isn't that just fucking
convenient for you!

02:40:41.090 --> 02:40:43.049
Now that I'm under
federal indictment,

02:40:43.050 --> 02:40:45.051
with an electronic bracelet
around my ankle,

02:40:45.052 --> 02:40:46.886
now you decide you don't
fucking love me anymore.

02:40:46.887 --> 02:40:48.705
- Is that right?
- No, no.

02:40:48.973 --> 02:40:51.307
What kind of person are you?
Tell me.

02:40:51.308 --> 02:40:52.642
You married me!

02:40:52.643 --> 02:40:54.227
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

02:40:54.228 --> 02:40:55.979
Jordan, this is how it's gonna go.

02:40:55.980 --> 02:40:58.231
I'm gonna take custody of the kids.

02:40:58.232 --> 02:41:00.316
If you agree to the
divorce right now,

02:41:00.317 --> 02:41:01.901
I will allow visitation.

02:41:01.902 --> 02:41:03.820
- Okay? Don't try to fight it.
- Oh, my God.

02:41:03.821 --> 02:41:05.321
It'll save us both a lot of money

02:41:05.322 --> 02:41:08.050
and I got a feeling
you're gonna need it.

02:41:09.535 --> 02:41:12.829
You're not taking my kids,
sweetheart. You hear me?

02:41:12.830 --> 02:41:14.330
I've already talked to the lawyer.

02:41:14.331 --> 02:41:15.582
He said even if you
don't get convicted,

02:41:15.583 --> 02:41:16.833
I've got a good chance
of getting them.

02:41:16.834 --> 02:41:18.001
I got news for you.

02:41:18.002 --> 02:41:19.752
You're not fucking
taking my children,

02:41:19.753 --> 02:41:21.526
you vicious fucking cunt, you!

02:41:21.922 --> 02:41:24.007
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

02:41:24.008 --> 02:41:26.259
You're not fucking taking
my goddamn fucking kids!

02:41:26.260 --> 02:41:27.703
You hear me? Fuck you!

02:41:27.845 --> 02:41:30.698
You're not fucking
taking my fucking kids!

02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:41.024
Fucking bitch!

02:41:43.444 --> 02:41:44.861
Fucking whore!

02:41:49.158 --> 02:41:51.977
Fucking bitch!
Piece of shit fucking whore!

02:42:01.003 --> 02:42:03.880
Look at yourself, Jordan.

02:42:03.881 --> 02:42:05.131
You're sick!

02:42:05.132 --> 02:42:06.382
You're a sick man!

02:42:06.383 --> 02:42:08.468
Fuck you! I told you,
you're not taking my fucking kids!

02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:11.054
You think I would let
my kids near you?

02:42:11.055 --> 02:42:12.305
Look at yourself!

02:42:12.306 --> 02:42:13.848
You know what my lawyer said?

02:42:13.849 --> 02:42:17.435
My lawyer said that you're going to
prison for 20 years, Jordan.

02:42:17.436 --> 02:42:20.772
Twenty fucking years! You're
never gonna see the kids again!

02:42:20.773 --> 02:42:22.023
You don't think I'm
not gonna see my...

02:42:22.024 --> 02:42:23.900
No, I'm not fucking
letting you near my kids!

02:42:23.901 --> 02:42:26.152
You don't think I'm gonna see
my fucking kids again, huh?

02:42:26.153 --> 02:42:27.755
Don't you fucking touch them!

02:42:28.989 --> 02:42:30.932
Don't you fucking touch me!

02:42:32.493 --> 02:42:35.828
Sweetheart? You're coming
on a trip with Daddy, all right?

02:42:35.829 --> 02:42:37.931
You're coming on a trip with Daddy.

02:42:40.584 --> 02:42:42.919
Don't you fucking touch her,
Jordan.

02:42:42.920 --> 02:42:45.773
I swear to God,
I will fucking kill you!

02:42:48.342 --> 02:42:49.676
It's all right, baby.

02:42:49.677 --> 02:42:51.010
You and Daddy are gonna go

02:42:51.011 --> 02:42:52.470
on a little trip together, okay?

02:42:52.471 --> 02:42:54.097
- A little trip together.
- Violet!

02:42:54.098 --> 02:42:55.265
Violet!

02:42:55.266 --> 02:42:57.517
- Get the key! Get the key!
- I got it!

02:42:57.518 --> 02:42:59.227
Jordan, you open this fucking door

02:42:59.228 --> 02:43:02.146
- right now! Open the door!
- Put your seat belt on.

02:43:02.147 --> 02:43:03.523
There you go. Get your legs in.

02:43:03.524 --> 02:43:05.275
I'm taking her with me!

02:43:05.276 --> 02:43:06.567
I told you I'm taking her with me,

02:43:06.568 --> 02:43:07.986
you fucking bitch!

02:43:07.987 --> 02:43:10.806
You're not gonna stop me!
You're not gonna stop me!

02:43:11.490 --> 02:43:13.638
We're going on a
little trip, honey.

02:43:13.993 --> 02:43:15.595
No! No!

02:43:16.078 --> 02:43:17.537
Get the hell out of here!

02:43:17.538 --> 02:43:19.789
Leave that baby alone!

02:43:19.790 --> 02:43:22.041
Violet! Garage door! Close it!

02:43:22.042 --> 02:43:23.251
Mommy!

02:43:23.252 --> 02:43:25.545
- Get out of here!
- Open the fucking door!

02:43:25.546 --> 02:43:27.148
Mommy!

02:43:30.551 --> 02:43:32.278
No!

02:43:39.476 --> 02:43:42.312
Oh, Lord! Oh, my heavens...

02:43:42.313 --> 02:43:43.688
Get the baby!

02:43:43.689 --> 02:43:45.917
Naomi, get the baby!

02:43:46.567 --> 02:43:48.276
- Mommy.
- Honey, it's okay.

02:43:48.277 --> 02:43:49.652
It's gonna be okay.

02:43:49.653 --> 02:43:51.755
Oh, Mr. Jordan has lost his mind.

02:43:52.656 --> 02:43:54.532
- Baby...
- It's all right, honey.

02:43:54.533 --> 02:43:56.200
She all right?

02:43:56.201 --> 02:43:57.553
Is she all right?

02:43:58.245 --> 02:43:59.892
What's the matter with you?

02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:01.523
Is she all right?

02:44:08.756 --> 02:44:10.256
<i>Paragraph 1.</i>

02:44:10.257 --> 02:44:11.841

<i>In conjunction with
the investigation...</i>

02:44:33.614 --> 02:44:35.261
Fucking brutal.

Quit your bitching.

02:44:40.788 --> 02:44:44.374
Please. Let me just sign
the fucking thing already.

02:44:44.375 --> 02:44:45.852
Thank you.

02:44:48.670 --> 02:44:49.962
Just here?

02:44:49.963 --> 02:44:51.565
That'd be good.

02:44:53.217 --> 02:44:54.425
Thank you.

02:44:54.426 --> 02:44:56.153
<i>It wasn't even a choice.</i>

<i>Anybody who 'd ever known me</i>

02:45:05.145 --> 02:45:07.522
<i>or taken so much as a stock tip.</i>

02:45:12.986 --> 02:45:15.430
Wolfie! Wolfie! Wolfie!

02:45:17.116 --> 02:45:18.889
<i>The first name on the
list was Donnie.</i>

02:45:22.287 --> 02:45:23.830
Jordan, do you know how good it is

02:45:23.831 --> 02:45:25.524
to have you back in this office?

02:45:25.791 --> 02:45:27.917
It's not the same when you're gone.

02:45:27.918 --> 02:45:29.710
It's sad, you understand?
It's like...

02:45:29.711 --> 02:45:31.254
That fucking Steve Madden, huh?

02:45:31.255 --> 02:45:32.505
I can't...

02:45:32.506 --> 02:45:34.382
Swear to God, I can't
even think about it.

02:45:34.383 --> 02:45:36.342
Every time I think about him,
my blood boils.

02:45:36.343 --> 02:45:38.136
I can't even say his name.

02:45:38.137 --> 02:45:39.762
- I know.
- It's, like, disgusting.

02:45:39.763 --> 02:45:42.181
I grew up with this guy
and he betrays me like that.

02:45:42.182 --> 02:45:43.329
Ugh!

02:45:43.392 --> 02:45:46.462
He ever get back to
you about that, um...

02:45:47.104 --> 02:45:49.081
About that account?

02:45:54.695 --> 02:45:55.820
You remember.

02:45:55.821 --> 02:45:57.864
It was like 4 or 5 mil,
something like that, right?

02:45:57.865 --> 02:46:01.139
He was supposed
to kick back 4 or 5 mil, was it?

02:46:05.456 --> 02:46:06.998
Actually, I was...

02:46:06.999 --> 02:46:08.458
I was fucked up, Jordan,

02:46:08.459 --> 02:46:10.042
- so I don't really remember.
- Yeah.

02:46:10.043 --> 02:46:12.145
Yeah, right. Stupid.

02:46:12.713 --> 02:46:14.338
Well, if he calls you,

02:46:14.339 --> 02:46:16.817
you make sure and contact me, okay?

02:46:18.552 --> 02:46:20.303
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah.

02:46:20.304 --> 02:46:22.498
Of course, yeah. No, of course.

02:46:25.809 --> 02:46:28.412
You gonna eat that last piece
of yellowtail, bud?

02:46:29.354 --> 02:46:31.172
No, it's all yours.

02:46:31.899 --> 02:46:33.342
Can I get this?

02:46:35.736 --> 02:46:37.588
So, what else is...

02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:42.325
Well, how's Naomi and everything?

02:46:42.326 --> 02:46:43.784
You know how it is.

02:46:43.785 --> 02:46:46.013
She hates my fucking guts.

02:46:47.623 --> 02:46:49.441
How's Hildy? Good?

02:46:50.167 --> 02:46:51.626
She's still alive, so

02:46:51.627 --> 02:46:53.794
my life is fucked, you know?

02:46:53.795 --> 02:46:55.112
Yeah.

02:47:01.803 --> 02:47:03.405
Mr. Jordan.

02:47:03.514 --> 02:47:04.866
Mmm?

02:47:04.973 --> 02:47:07.292
Mr. Jordan, you got a visitor.

02:47:07.559 --> 02:47:08.706
What?

02:47:09.061 --> 02:47:10.913
You've got a visitor.

02:47:26.328 --> 02:47:28.454
I need you to get dressed.

02:47:28.455 --> 02:47:30.728
Why? What the fuck's going on?

02:47:35.671 --> 02:47:37.489
You're going to jail.

02:47:49.434 --> 02:47:50.685
All right.

02:47:50.686 --> 02:47:52.228
I'll get some clothes on.

02:47:52.229 --> 02:47:54.548
We'll give you a hand with that.

02:48:03.323 --> 02:48:04.470
Okay.

02:48:16.628 --> 02:48:17.945
FBI!

02:48:18.297 --> 02:48:19.839
Everybody sit down. Put your hands

02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:21.966
where they can be seen,
and shut up!

02:48:21.967 --> 02:48:23.759
Don't you fucking touch me.

02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:25.970
Get your fucking hands off me!

02:48:25.971 --> 02:48:27.789
Don't get out of your seats!

02:48:40.944 --> 02:48:42.637
It's fucking Chanel!

02:48:55.208 --> 02:48:57.402
<i>I gave up everyone.</i>

02:48:57.461 --> 02:48:59.045
<i>And in return,</i>

02:48:59.046 --> 02:49:03.492
<i>I got three years in some hellhole
in Nevada I'd never even heard of.</i>

02:49:05.302 --> 02:49:07.780
<i>Like my pops, Mad Max, had said,</i>

02:49:08.430 --> 02:49:11.158
<i>"The chickens had
come home to roost."</i>

02:49:12.434 --> 02:49:14.787
<i>Whatever the fuck that means.</i>

02:49:18.231 --> 02:49:19.607
<i>I hope Your Honor would agree</i>

02:49:19.608 --> 02:49:21.734
that Mr. Belfort has
distinguished himself

02:49:21.735 --> 02:49:23.903
in terms of his cooperation.

02:49:23.904 --> 02:49:26.030
Mr. Belfort has helped the
government win convictions

02:49:26.031 --> 02:49:28.680
of over two dozen serious offenders

02:49:29.785 --> 02:49:31.786
and helped them
recover millions of dollars

02:49:31.787 --> 02:49:35.357
to be made available
for restitution to their victims.

02:49:37.501 --> 02:49:39.043
The sentence of the court shall be

02:49:39.044 --> 02:49:41.272
36 months in federal prison.

02:49:42.964 --> 02:49:45.192
Please remand the defendant.

02:49:47.302 --> 02:49:49.154
I'm sorry.

02:49:51.932 --> 02:49:53.079
That's okay.

02:50:41.356 --> 02:50:43.899
<i>I'm not ashamed to admit it.</i>

02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:45.818
<i>When we arrived at the prison,</i>

02:50:45.819 --> 02:50:48.092
<i>I was absolutely terrified.</i>

02:50:48.780 --> 02:50:50.197
Belfort, on your feet.

02:50:50.198 --> 02:50:52.596
<i>But I needn't have been.</i>

02:50:52.743 --> 02:50:55.437
<i>You see, for a brief
fleeting moment,</i>

02:50:56.037 --> 02:50:58.231
<i>I 'd forgotten I was rich.</i>

02:50:59.124 --> 02:51:02.649
<i>And I lived in a place
where everything was for sale.</i>

02:51:05.088 --> 02:51:07.840
<i>Wouldn't you like to
learn how to sell it?</i>

02:51:07.841 --> 02:51:10.843
<i>So listen. I've met some
bad motherfuckers in my life.</i>

02:51:10.844 --> 02:51:12.261
<i>I'm talking about rock stars,</i>

02:51:12.262 --> 02:51:14.346
<i>professional athletes, gangsters.</i>

02:51:14.347 --> 02:51:16.223
<i>I'm telling you,
some real bad motherfuckers.</i>

02:51:16.224 --> 02:51:18.642
<i>But this guy, my good friend,</i>

02:51:18.643 --> 02:51:21.479
<i>Mr. Jordan Belfort, is the single</i>

02:51:21.480 --> 02:51:24.333
baddest motherfucker
I have ever met.

02:51:24.816 --> 02:51:26.609
So I want you right now

02:51:26.610 --> 02:51:29.820
to give a warm Auckland,
New Zealand welcome

02:51:29.821 --> 02:51:31.489
for my good friend

02:51:31.490 --> 02:51:34.283
and the world's
greatest sales trainer,

02:51:34.284 --> 02:51:35.476
Mr. Jordan Belfort!

02:51:47.506 --> 02:51:48.903
Thank you.

02:52:11.738 --> 02:52:13.556
Sell me this pen.

02:52:18.078 --> 02:52:20.180
It's, uh...

02:52:20.413 --> 02:52:22.265
It's an amazing pen.

02:52:22.457 --> 02:52:24.730
For professionals, it's a...

02:52:27.754 --> 02:52:29.572
Sell me this pen.

02:52:30.507 --> 02:52:31.757
Well, it's a nice pen.

02:52:31.758 --> 02:52:33.133
You can use the pen

02:52:33.134 --> 02:52:36.488
to write down thoughts
from your life so you can...

02:52:38.181 --> 02:52:39.703
Sell me

02:52:39.975 --> 02:52:41.622
this pen.

02:52:43.520 --> 02:52:44.792
Well...

02:52:45.105 --> 02:52:48.800
This pen works and I
personally love this pen...
