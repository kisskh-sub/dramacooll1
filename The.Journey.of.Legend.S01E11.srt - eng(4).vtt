[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.870
[Episode 11]

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.310
Miss Qing,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.360
we've searched Xiao Qiushui thoroughly

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.890
and found nothing unusual.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.590
[The Power Gang has never]

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.190
[replied to Song until now,]

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.960
[just to trap Xiao Qiushui]

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.140
[and obtain the Hero Command Token.]

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.750
[I'll definitely make him]

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.079
[reveal where the Hero Command Token is.]

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.000
Who are you?

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.090
Didn't Tang Fang tell you?

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.150
I'm her close friend in the Tang Sect,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.550
and together we're known
as the beauty duo.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.360
She sent me to take good care of you.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.030
What did you make me take?

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.950
Even a master of peerless martial arts,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.480
after taking that special pill,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.000
has to do whatever I say.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.470
The Hero Command Token

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.590
and all your secrets—

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.000
tell me everything.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.280
Who are you?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Xiao Qiushui…

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.080
Xiao Qiushui from Huanhua Sect.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.959
Between Tang Fang and me,

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.649
who is more beautiful?

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.870
You…

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.990
You're a bit uglier than her.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.120
What?

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.750
Your hand is rotting
from using too much poison.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.610
-You...
-Qing!

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.040
Stop.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.640
Did he say
where the Hero Command Token is?

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.430
Xiao Qiushui, tell me,

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.070
where is the Hero Command Token now?

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.680
In the Tang Sect.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.800
Song, that's impossible.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.450
I've searched both him and Tang Fang.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.620
They don't have the token.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.000
Xiao Qiushui.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.630
Xiao Qiushui!

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.750
Tell me,

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.630
where in the Tang Sect
did you hide the Hero Command Token?

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.190
Didn't I just tell you?

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:37.560
The Hero Command Token

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.480
is buried in the Tang Sect.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.270
I only remember it's in the bamboo grove.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.780
Looks like this brat had a backup plan

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.890
before entering the Tang Sect.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.010
Let's go.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.190
Two idiots.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.330
Good thing I came prepared.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.870
Miss Tang.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.190
If I accidentally take
the Tang Sect's poison,

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.190
is there a cure?

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.000
It's not that I don't trust you.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.150
Here is the antidote.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.070
It's a treasure of the Tang Sect.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.790
It's a cure for most poisons.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.600
But it only lasts for 4 hours.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.360
[Tang Fang never mentioned]

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.510
[there were such despicable people
in the Tang Sect.]

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.240
[I wonder how she's doing now.]

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.720
Miss!

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.510
Miss,

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.120
are you alright?

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.750
He said it was half a mile away.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.070
We've dug around
almost every tree in this area

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.000
and still haven't found the token.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.240
Could that Xiao boy have lied to me?

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.430
Impossible.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.230
No one can resist
the effects of that special pill.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.980
He couldn't have lied.

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:50.890
Xiao Qiushui, are you alright?

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.070
I'm fine.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.790
Thankfully,
I had the antidote you gave me.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.680
Let's get out of here.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.480
Xiao Qiushui!

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.680
Xiao Qiushui, how dare you lie to us?

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.600
I didn't.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.210
Did you find anything?

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.120
Fang,

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.870
you don't have to die

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:11.930
with this Xiao boy.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.480
Beg me now.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.950
If you beg me,
I'll always soften toward you.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:18.920
Song!

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.120
Is there something wrong with him?

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.480
Young Master Xiao, if we've offended you,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.540
please forgive us.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.190
Actually, now that you have
the Hero Command Token,

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.800
what danger can really threaten you?

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.150
I can introduce you to my grandmother.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.200
With her experience in the martial world,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.750
she can help you
use the Hero Command Token wisely,

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.409
lift the siege on the Xiao family,
and ruin the villains' schemes.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.630
Let me tell you the truth.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.650
The Hero Command Token

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.930
has already been taken by the Power Gang.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.120
Young Master Xiao,
you're still not being honest.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.910
How do you know I'm lying?

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.470
Let me ask you.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.370
Did the Power Gang tell you

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.720
they never got the token?

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.690
Do you really have dealings
with the Power Gang?

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.510
Fang, who are you to question me?

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:14.630
You went to the Xiao Residence

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.560
just to get the Hero Command Token.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.020
Young Master Xiao,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.030
that's the only reason
she went to the Xiao Residence.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.830
You've noticed it, haven't you?

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.600
And, Fang,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.910
I've already reported
that you brought an outsider

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:30.970
into the Tang Sect.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.870
Why hasn't your father come to see you?

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.150
Could the rumors be true—
that he's gravely injured

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.410
and hasn't recovered?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.630
If so, your branch of the family
will hardly hold out.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.030
You should beg me nicely

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.510
to marry you.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.850
Then I'll spare
your branch of the family in the future.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.630
My father's internal energy
is on the verge of a breakthrough.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.750
He's cultivating in seclusion.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.270
What's so strange about that?

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.400
If you have the guts,

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.030
go force your way
into the sect leader's quarters!

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.030
Let's see

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.180
if my father would let you leave
in one piece.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.960
If you don't have the guts,

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.600
shut up and get out of my way!

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:09.840
You…

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.200
Sorry to interrupt,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.440
but is the Tang Sect

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.840
always so full of schemes

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.240
and infighting?

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:21.670
Yes, it is.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.040
How else would one survive here?

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:26.720
Wait!

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.250
Since we've come to the Tang Sect,

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.390
let's follow the Tang Sect's rules.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.130
Look behind you!

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:43.960
Run!

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.440
That way.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:07.590
Xiao Qiushui.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.750
What's wrong, Tang Fang?

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.440
I'm sorry.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.720
Since we were in the Sword Manor,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.910
I've been plotting to stay close to you,

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.910
just to find the "Voidheart Codex."

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.510
But you trusted me so much

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.840
and treated me as a friend.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.500
I brought you to the Tang Sect,

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.510
hoping I'd help you save the Xiao family
so I could ask you

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.510
to repay my favor.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.240
It was all just
for my own selfish desires.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.800
Tang Fang,

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.150
I don't know
where the "Voidheart Codex" is.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.510
But if we find Crazy Yan,

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.550
maybe we can learn

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.870
its whereabouts.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.570
After saving my family,

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.910
if one day

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.000
I do find the "Voidheart Codex,"

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.720
I'll tell you where it is.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:56.440
Thank you.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.240
Over there!

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.650
Let's go!

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.800
No time to hesitate.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:11.600
Jump!

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:20.440
Move aside!

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.250
Careful! You overshot it.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.090
Your sleeve is torn.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.630
It's torn.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.440
All of you stay inside! Don't look!

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.480
You want to fight again?

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.320
I once made a vow—

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.270
if any man saw my body,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.390
I'd kill him.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:11.790
And of all people…

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.710
That's quite a rash vow you made.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.840
If I hadn't pulled you just now,

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.700
you'd have fallen into the river.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.750
Before my father became
the head of the family,

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.240
scoundrels from other factions
always bullied us.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.510
One day, while I was bathing,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.880
they barged in and harassed me.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.540
My mother killed them all.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.000
That day,

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.600
I made a vow—

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.630
I'd train hard,

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.240
and if any man saw my body again,

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.640
I'd have to kill him.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.630
You should consider the circumstances
with such a deadly vow.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.150
If it's a wicked man doing it on purpose,
you should kill him,

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.670
but I just saved you.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.700
My mother said,

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.720
unless the man is my husband,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.120
there are no exceptions.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.810
Are you kidding me?

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.170
Anyway, that's the vow I swore.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.610
Don't overthink it.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.810
Then let me ask you something.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.300
This vow you made as a child

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.630
actually has many loopholes.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.560
If someone accidentally
glanced at your body

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.370
without seeing it clearly,

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.840
would you have to kill him too?

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.360
Who knows if he meant it or not?

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.270
I made this vow in my late mother's name.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.400
I'll never break it.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.050
You're insane. What kind of logic is that?

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.280
I'm not going to argue with you.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.550
Then tell me this:

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.720
don't you consider me a friend?

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.120
You'd even kill a friend?

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.660
I already told you,

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.360
no exceptions.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.620
I don't want to fight with you.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.480
You'd better step aside.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:14.670
No way.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.360
Excuse me, you two.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.000
I've been listening to you for a while

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.460
and can't take it anymore.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.320
You don't want to die, do you?

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.360
You don't want to kill him, do you?

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.810
Isn't there another solution?

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.580
You just need to marry her.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:46.750
Miss,

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:47.960
I can see

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.600
you can't bring yourself to do it.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.030
But you can't stay on my boat

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.030
forever, can you?

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.150
M-Me? Marry her?

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.240
She's right.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.770
If you want to live, there's only one way.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.150
Marry me.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.320
Stop fooling around.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.980
Marriage isn't child's play.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.480
How can you just ask me

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.480
to marry you?

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.400
I can't break my vow anyway.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.330
I still have many things to do.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.150
I can't kill you for now.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.440
But as it happens,

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.440
I need someone to help me

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.080
break into the Snare Formation
of the Tang Sect.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.510
Only then can I get Tang Song off my back.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.970
Otherwise, I'll have to...

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.360
I can help you with that.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.360
But you're right.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:45.910
I gave Rou my word.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.150
Is the Snare Formation difficult
to break through?

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.550
It's basically a death trap.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.890
If you can make it out alive,

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.910
we'll hold a wedding ceremony.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.369
Afterward, I'll just divorce you.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.810
Just don't make decisions on your own.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:11.890
It's settled then.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:16.589
Sorry for holding up
your wedding procession.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:19.450
This money is both compensation
and a wedding gift.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.720
Congratulations on your wedding.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.510
I wish you a long and happy marriage.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.640
May you be blessed with children soon!

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.000
Stop looking.
It has nothing to do with you.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.660
We need to hurry to Guangling.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.640
How are you going?

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.570
Do you have a map?

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.030
A map of Jinzhong?

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.880
These red dots must be
the hidden lookout posts.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.340
I went to Tang Song's place

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.240
to see you but couldn't find you.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.510
I saw him locking this in a drawer.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.640
He said

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.440
he spent a lot of effort and time

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.440
marking all the strongholds

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.680
of the Power Gang.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.870
I guess these sects marked in red

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.170
have all aligned themselves
with the Power Gang.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.590
Look, these strongholds

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.160
are all on the main routes to Guangling.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.640
I can't believe
the Wuhupeng Sect, the Tanglang Sect,

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.370
and the Wuyi Gang

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.700
have all submitted to the Power Gang.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.680
With these sects in the way,

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.310
Yiren's reinforcements
from Guangling to the Sword Manor

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:53.590
will be hindered.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:55.880
He'll have to take a detour.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.680
If that's not possible,

00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:59.610
we'll need to find a way

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.180
to clear these obstacles.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:04.890
It's decided then.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.030
And don't forget—

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.920
once the Sword Manor is safe,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.270
you must go challenge the formation,

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.030
or I'll have to take your life.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:14.920
As for that,

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.680
we need to think about it carefully.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.590
Don't overthink it.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.850
Let fate decide.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:23.560
Let's go.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.030
Spread the word

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.000
that Xiao Qiushui and Tang Fang

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.200
have taken
the Hero Command Token to Guangling.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.260
You want everyone to know about that?

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.350
They think they can escape my grasp.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:43.750
It won't be that easy.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.480
Once the news spreads,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.220
people from the martial world
will go after Xiao Qiushui.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.000
I'd like to see how long he can last.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:56.260
[Xiao Residence]

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.350
Kaiyan.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.440
Xueyu?

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:04.790
You may leave now.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.030
Any messages
from the Sword Manor in Jindu?

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.160
What did Father say?

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.070
These are all messages from our men

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.530
at the ferry stops
confirming their safety.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.030
Father hasn't replied.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.160
I'm afraid that as time passes,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.680
all the clues and evidence in the village

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.680
will be wiped out.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.310
Let's go to that village again.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.680
We should examine everything carefully

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.210
and preserve the evidence.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.840
Alright.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.610
These herbs are used for pill-making.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.240
Perhaps we can develop

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.370
an antidote for the villagers.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:20.900
Xueyu!

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.180
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.940
Let's check on Kaiyan.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.440
Kaiyan.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.620
His internal energy
is temporarily blocked.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.880
It's nothing serious.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.520
Kaiyan.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.070
Kaiyan.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.580
What happened?

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:52.480
Are you okay?

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.270
What happened to me?

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.800
If I hadn't arrived in time,

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.510
you two would've been dead by now.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.000
How many times have I told you

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.200
not to act on your own?

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.720
That person in black just now

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.540
must have come to destroy evidence.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.000
We couldn't just stand by.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:06.230
I've told you before—

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.110
we must look at the bigger picture
and prioritize the Xiao family.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.440
Even if you find
the evidence now, so what?

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.160
Will the Power Gang actually
reason with us?

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.030
In the end, it'll just put

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.440
the Xiao family in open conflict
with the Power Gang.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.310
Yiren.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:34.960
I just found this.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.880
This snake-needle grass

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.210
looks very similar to the diamond flower.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.270
The villagers' poisoning and madness

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.670
might be related to this.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.750
Yiren, Xueyu has a healer's compassion

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.510
and is eager to save lives.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.040
But that was close just now.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:51.400
That man's internal energy
was overwhelming.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.880
He almost killed the two of us.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.400
We should just wait for Father's message

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.820
and follow his instructions.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.200
I know you mean well,

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.070
but from now on,
whenever you make decisions

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.330
or something happens,

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.690
talk with me first.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.960
I'm not just your elder brother.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.040
I'm also the acting leader
of the Huanhua Sect.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.680
Your strategy actually

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.760
eliminated 2 Power Gang strongholds

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.380
and cleared a path for us.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.750
The reinforcements
can go to Jinzhong without hindrance now.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.550
Judging by when Old Madam Wu
sent the message,

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.200
Yiren should have

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.380
returned to Jinzhong
from Guangling by now.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.270
Unfortunately, on our way here,

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.000
we haven't seen any sign of him.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.510
I'm afraid
something might have gone wrong.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.310
Let's do this.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.690
We'll go buy a fast horse now

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.490
and head straight for Guangling to check.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.720
These are all mules and donkeys.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:55.750
They're not fast.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.580
Sir, what do you want?

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.310
A donkey or a horse?

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.350
There's a good horse over there.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.640
You have a good eye, sir.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.030
That's a great horse that can run

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:09.880
incredibly far in a day.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.440
But it's a bit expensive.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.590
How did you get such a fine horse?

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.880
I bought it, of course.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.600
There's still a military seal
on the stirrup.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.480
Tell me the truth.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.730
Where did that horse come from?

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.130
It's fine if you don't want to tell us.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.950
We'll have to
report it to the authorities.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.280
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.980
That horse dealer said

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.070
he was passing by here yesterday

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.810
and saw this soldier lying dead here.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.320
That's why he took the horse.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.310
Sorry.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.550
This is the messenger sent by Old Madam Wu

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.550
to Guangling to ask Yiren for help.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.270
With such a blockade,

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.240
Yiren and the others

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:02.880
probably have no idea

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.540
about our current situation.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.030
So I need to hurry back
to meet up with Yiren.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:15.550
The checkpoint ahead

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.200
is where Chuanjin and Guangling meet.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.720
Looks like it's already
under the Power Gang's control.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.480
The terrain here makes this place
hard to breach.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.650
There's another ferry stop ahead.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.530
It's not under the Power Gang's control.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.880
Let's go there first.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:37.090
The rain is heavy this season,
and the river has risen a lot.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.600
It may be hard to find a ferry.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.010
We still have to figure something out.

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:14.110
[Here lies a brave
and loyal soldier of the Wu Army]

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.480
Tang Song is so useless.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.440
Xiao Qiushui had entered the Tang Sect,

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.170
but he still couldn't keep him.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.160
Tang Song is spreading rumors

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.690
that Xiao Qiushui
has the Hero Command Token.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:31.550
I'm afraid

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.830
many people are already planning

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.230
to go after Xiao Qiushui.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:36.790
Master, should I

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:39.050
go kill this good-for-nothing Tang Song

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:39.880
for you?

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.100
There's something more important
for you to do.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.110
Before Xiao Qiushui
parted ways with Old Madam Wu,

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.080
she dismissed everyone else

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:49.750
and spoke with him alone.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.200
So the Hero Command Token

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.060
is very likely in his possession.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.090
Starting today,

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.880
whoever brings Xiao Qiushui
to the Power Gang

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.200
will be rewarded with the Wind Token.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.400
But the Wind Token is your personal token.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.720
It allows its holder
to make a request of you.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.750
Chief once said

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:08.680
this token would give people
leverage over you.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.110
He forbade you from using it again.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:10.840
Don't worry.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.110
At worst, I'll just kill the holder

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.770
before they make any request.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.000
Xiao Qiushui failed
to get help in Jinzhong,

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.440
so he must be rushing to Guangling now.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:26.970
Go after him immediately.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:27.640
Yes.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:29.880
Tang Fang…

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.370
Is she still with Xiao Qiushui?

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:34.230
Yes.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.590
Feng.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.350
I stole some rice cakes
from the kitchen for you.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:16.150
Hurry and eat.

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:18.000
Don't let them find out.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.210
[Guangling is the Sword King's territory.]

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.450
[Tang Fang is also in Guangling.]

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:44.200
Fang.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.310
Sir.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.910
Take care.
Come back for more if you like it.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.750
Here. Eat something.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.590
This situation is urgent,
and time is tight.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.510
Go check if there are any inns nearby.

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:04.440
I'll look over there

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.680
for other boatmen

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:09.290
and see if I can book a boat
that leaves early tomorrow morning.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:10.510
Be careful.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.350
[Father, Mother.]

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.290
[Are you both alright?]

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.720
[Wait for me.]

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.450
[I'll hurry back as soon as I can.]

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:46.790
Sir.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.680
Are there any other

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.680
ferry stops or boatmen around here?

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:51.480
No.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.680
Thanks.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.570
Sir.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.500
I heard you're looking for an inn.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.480
There's an inn called Ferry Inn nearby.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.540
There are two guys there up to no good.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.750
I'm afraid your friend might get tricked.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:06.480
Be careful.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.150
[Ferry Inn]

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:21.880
Anyone here?

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:24.310
[Tie Xingyue, the Fart King]

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.720
Hello? Is the owner here?

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:28.670
Yes, yes.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:29.840
Are you alone, sir?

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.610
[Qiu Nangu, Iron Mouth]

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.880
You're the owner?

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:35.510
Yes, I'm the owner.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.420
Is this inn converted from a cattle shed?

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.510
It's dirty and stinks of cow dung.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:41.990
Can anyone stay here?

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.030
Sir, sir,

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.750
I rarely get customers,

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.200
so I don't clean often.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:49.480
My apologies.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.830
I'll clean it up for you right away.

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.560
Don't bother. I'm not staying.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.680
Now that you've come in,

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.880
you can't leave so easily.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.510
You…

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.790
Tie, that was some convincing acting!

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.000
Of course.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:18.080
That girl from the Tang Sect

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.770
has powerful hidden weapons,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.350
but they're no match
for your knockout powder.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:22.810
She passed out instantly.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.000
There's no one I can't knock out.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:29.290
But speaking of which,

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.640
wasn't Xiao Qiushui

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.700
supposed to come with this Tang girl?

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.340
Why hasn't he shown up yet?

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.550
Don't worry.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:39.720
Xiao Qiushui

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.590
will definitely come
to save this Tang girl.

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.190
We'll just wait here for him.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.350
Exactly. Let's wait for him

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.530
to walk right into our trap.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.960
Speak of the devil.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:33:59.950
Let's go.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:00.660
Hurry!

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:06.230
Quick! Give me the antidote.

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:08.260
The antidote! Now.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:10.760
Here.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:21.110
Tell me,

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.170
who are you people?

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.400
I'm Tie Xingyue, the Fart King.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.650
I'm Qiu Nangu, Iron Mouth.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.380
You've heard of me, right?

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:35.630
Where is that girl now?

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.140
You're here to save that girl.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.620
You're Xiao Qiushui, aren't you?

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.840
So you're after Xiao Qiushui.

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.480
It's not us who want him.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.590
The Power Gang wants him.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.820
Liu Suifeng from the Power Gang
has spread the word:

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:58.270
whoever brings Xiao Qiushui
to him

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.920
will get a token in exchange.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:02.160
That token is extremely valuable.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.360
If the two of us want
to join the Power Gang,

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.330
he wouldn't dare refuse us.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:18.030
So you want to side with Liu Suifeng

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.360
and join the Power Gang?

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.190
Liu Suifeng's offer

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.800
is tempting.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.800
But

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:27.480
we've already made contact
with the Sword King

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.480
of the Power Gang.

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:30.360
Although we haven't met in person,

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.070
we can't switch sides so easily.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.070
We value loyalty.

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.480
Right. Loyalty!

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.350
If we hand over the person Liu Suifeng
has been looking for

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.320
to the Sword King,

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.920
the Sword King will surely be pleased.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.630
I was questioning him.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:41.920
Why did you spill everything?

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:42.510
You fool.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.980
You started first.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.450
Are you Xiao Qiushui or not?

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.110
Come on, get up and talk.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.880
I was a bit rough just now.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:59.880
I apologize for that.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:02.320
But

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.960
you're mistaken.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.670
I'm not Xiao Qiushui.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.070
And we're supposed to believe that?

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:09.190
What proof do you have?

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.520
I've got a name of my own.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.030
I'm Xiao Donghuo.

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:16.440
Wait.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.510
Xiao Donghuo?

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:33.100
That name...

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:34.950
Sounds familiar, right?

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.350
I am indeed very familiar with him.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.680
He's a distant relative of mine.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.070
Only I and that girl you captured

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.330
know where Xiao Qiushui is hiding.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.840
If she wasn't with Xiao Qiushui,

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:51.270
why would she be with you?

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:52.590
Truth is,

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.530
the two of them had a falling-out.

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.320
So she asked me

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.590
to help teach Xiao Qiushui a lesson.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.190
Which means

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:03.960
if you want to find Xiao Qiushui,

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.230
you must ask her.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.640
But the word from the martial world

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.590
is
that Xiao Qiushui is
headed to Guangling

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.560
with the Hero Command Token.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.110
We didn't catch Xiao Qiushui

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.230
but got Xiao Donghuo?

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.800
No. He's playing us.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:29.790
You…

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.360
The Hero Command Token is priceless.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.000
If Xiao Qiushui knew

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.020
the Power Gang was
pursuing him so relentlessly,

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.940
he'd have hidden far away by now.

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:41.070
You seem wise, sir.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.960
Why don't you tell me what you think?

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:46.730
You have a good eye.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.800
I've poisoned that wine. Don't drink it.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.550
But you're right.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.090
That girl's no longer with us.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:03.070
If you don't start telling the truth,

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:04.400
I'll have to beat you up.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:05.640
Hold on. Hold on.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.160
That won't be necessary.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.510
I'll just tell you.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
We've already handed that girl over

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:13.670
to the person who connected us
with the Sword King—

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:16.920
Zuo Changsheng,
the Burrow Demon of the Power Gang.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:20.310
He plans to present that girl
to the Sword King.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.920
Tell me the truth.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.590
It is the truth.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.330
If you don't believe me,

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:26.880
stab me with that sword.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:28.390
Don't stab my friend!

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.920
Tie, don't play the hero!

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.670
Sir, stab me instead.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.590
Once you do,

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:34.760
you'll know he's telling the truth.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.630
Let him stab me.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:36.230
Stab me!

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.660
My buddy is weak. Don't stab him. Stab me.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.400
Alright, stop arguing.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.030
You've done something stupid.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.730
What do you mean?

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:50.510
If the Burrow Demon learns from Tang Fang

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:51.920
about Xiao Qiushui's whereabouts,

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.440
he'll definitely bring Xiao Qiushui

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.510
to the Sword King.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:55.840
If that happens,

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:59.190
won't he steal all your credit?

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.800
He's right.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.350
The urgent matter now

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.710
is to find the Burrow Demon

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.670
and then secretly get Tang Fang

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:12.910
back.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:17.400
Qiu, he didn't stab either of us,

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.420
and he's even giving us advice.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.180
I kind of like this guy.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.030
We could be friends with him.

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.480
Since we're friends,

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.110
and that girl is so important to him,

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:28.710
we must help him get her back.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.440
Alright.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.960
Hey, Donghuo,

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.000
we'll take care of it for you.

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:35.750
We'll take you there.

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:53.190
Master.

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:55.640
I've received news.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.030
The Sword King's men have taken Tang Fang.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:00.440
What about Xiao Qiushui? Where is he?

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:02.590
Guangling is
under the Sword King's control.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.110
Our spies have been rooted out by him.

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:06.040
We haven't found Xiao Qiushui yet.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.640
But he'll definitely seek help.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.410
That would naturally mean Qu Hanshan,

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:14.110
He Who Shakes Guangling,

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:16.350
one of Guangling's Three Peaks.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.670
I've already sent people

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:19.760
to investigate Tang Fang's situation.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.760
Tang Fang and the Hero Command Token

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.480
must not slip through my fingers again.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.920
Understood.

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:31.190
You don't allow anyone
to hurt Miss Tang Fang.

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:32.850
That makes her your weakness.

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:36.170
I spoke out of turn.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:41.370
Go do your work.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:43.190
Yes.
