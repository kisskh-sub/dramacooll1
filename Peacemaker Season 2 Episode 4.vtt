00:56.973 --> 00:58.516
What the fuck is that?

01:07.692 --> 01:08.777
Dad, don't!

01:16.033 --> 01:17.077
Tell me "don't"?

01:18.286 --> 01:19.996
Since when I take orders from you?

01:29.672 --> 01:31.424
Dad, there's something over there,

01:32.258 --> 01:33.426
where he was going.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.375
Lion to Claws,

04:10.458 --> 04:12.210
we'll be there in less than ten minutes.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.336
Copy, Lion.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.138
What are you looking at?

04:24.222 --> 04:26.099
Remember that time
you smashed my car with a truck

04:26.224 --> 04:28.518
and snuck up behind me
and hit me in the head with a tire iron?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.687
-Yeah. Why?
-Just curious.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.188
Well, it was a great fucking moment.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.439
Hot take.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.358
You hit this little Chinaman
with a tire iron?

04:35.441 --> 04:37.694
I'm Vietnamese, Wild Bill Suckcock.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.320
And yes, he did.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.488
I wish I'd killed him.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.658
I wish he was sitting there
right now, dead.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.077
You wish my corpse was here
in front of you?

04:46.159 --> 04:47.704
-Yes.
-You would carry it around

04:47.787 --> 04:49.789
-with you everywhere?
-Yeah, 'cause you're small and light,

04:49.872 --> 04:51.582
and it's a reminder of my victory.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.626
So, you'd torment my loved ones

04:53.710 --> 04:56.087
who'd have to watch you
carry around my dead body?

04:57.714 --> 04:59.799
You're taking it
a little too seriously now.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.884
Shit, Ginger Cool, you are hardcore.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.469
Hey, fuck you too, asshole.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.679
Shit.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.849
GC is a little upset
'cause we're about to go arrest his friend

05:07.932 --> 05:09.559
and kill his favorite parrot.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.728
You know, I wasn't gonna say anything,

05:11.811 --> 05:14.355
but does Bordeaux know
that you were making faces

05:14.439 --> 05:15.648
when you were on the phone with her?

05:15.732 --> 05:17.525
I don't know what this man
is talking about.

05:17.608 --> 05:20.862
If I was making a face,
then that comes with having a face.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.157
What kind of faces?

05:24.240 --> 05:25.450
He winked at me

05:25.533 --> 05:28.244
like he had you wrapped around
his fucking finger.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.497
-You winked at him?
-No.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.334
I'll take a polygraph.
I don't give a shit.

05:34.417 --> 05:37.337
If I did, it was a wink like,
"Hey, we're all in this together."

05:37.420 --> 05:40.048
When the fuck does a wink mean
"we're all in this together"?

05:40.131 --> 05:43.217
I'm from Illinois.
It-- Maybe it's a Midwestern thing.

05:43.301 --> 05:46.763
I spent many years
in the hills of Illi-noise hunting balds,

05:46.846 --> 05:50.641
and ain't nobody ever winked at my ass
to say we're in this together.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.518
And that there is a point for Hagrid here.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.188
I don't want you on my side,
you fucking psychopath.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.815
You judge me for ridding the world
of beak-ed vermin

05:57.899 --> 06:01.361
when you hit
a little incapacitated Chinaman!

06:01.444 --> 06:03.613
He just said he was from Vietnam, asshole.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.157
Well, ain't that one of the places
Chinamens come from?

06:06.240 --> 06:09.827
Question, are you the dumbest cunt
who's ever existed, or just top five?

06:10.578 --> 06:11.746
That ain't nice at all, son.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.664
Shut the fuck up, all of you!

06:13.748 --> 06:14.999
Hey, I didn't say anything.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.043
Now, you did, didn't you?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.449
Jesus.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.620
Eagly?

07:04.674 --> 07:06.717
Eagly, what happened?

07:11.848 --> 07:14.308
-Claws to Lion. Copy?
-Copy, Claws.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.560
We're in position.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.812
-Waiting on your word.
-Less than a minute out.

07:17.895 --> 07:18.896
No.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.566
It's not your food. This is my food.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.193
My food's over here.
Your food's over there.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.363
Fuck it.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.215
"Get..."

07:46.799 --> 07:49.302
"Get out--
Get out of your house innediately"?

07:49.385 --> 07:50.887
Or maybe he means "immediately,"
I don't know.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.521
"Argus tagent."
What the fuck is a "tagent"?

08:02.565 --> 08:04.650
Oh, fuck. Wait.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.235
We'll enter at the front.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.237
Jagger and Kline,
make your way to the back.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.616
Fleury, left side.
Economos and St. Wild, right.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.204
Shit!

08:17.747 --> 08:21.209
Well, you said I didn't have to work
with Captain Cultural Appropriation.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.377
Fuck. Fine.

08:24.837 --> 08:25.796
Shit.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.054
Eagly, we gotta go.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.306
No, bro.

08:35.389 --> 08:36.432
We gotta go!

08:42.563 --> 08:43.773
Motherfucker!

08:46.400 --> 08:48.486
Hey, hey. Here. Yeah, yeah.

08:48.569 --> 08:51.948
That's right. Yeah, baloney?
Yeah, come on. Come on.

09:03.876 --> 09:04.919
Come on.

09:23.771 --> 09:24.814
Eagle droppings.

09:27.692 --> 09:28.693
That's good.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.161
Four days old.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.082
Hints of... cold cuts.

09:44.625 --> 09:45.668
Tater chips.

10:01.726 --> 10:02.727
Ki...

10:04.312 --> 10:05.688
ai!

10:09.775 --> 10:10.776
Come on!

10:33.716 --> 10:34.884
What the hell, bro?

10:34.967 --> 10:37.136
You screwed the world once.
I won't let you do it again.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.739
Say goodbye, demonic bir--

11:00.034 --> 11:01.160
Oh, shit.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.112
You're like a piece of toilet paper
stuck to my shoe...

11:36.862 --> 11:38.447
I just can't pick off.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.341
Yes!

11:58.759 --> 11:59.802
Snap.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.264
"...like to gift you..."

12:10.813 --> 12:14.275
Man, this is so fucking cool.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.029
Here we go.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.949
Snap.

12:22.950 --> 12:26.620
Pretty sweet, huh?

12:30.291 --> 12:32.918
"ASAP"?

12:39.175 --> 12:40.301
Somebody get Economos.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.510
Thank God.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.639
Man. That was insane.
It's the craziest thing I've--

12:45.723 --> 12:46.974
Oh, my God.

12:48.517 --> 12:49.852
What the hell happened?

12:49.935 --> 12:52.563
I... I came up behind you
when you were about to shoot Eagl--

12:53.063 --> 12:54.106
That eagle.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.734
Yeah, I remember getting a beat on it,

12:56.817 --> 12:58.694
-but I can't quite remember...
-Yeah, and--

12:58.778 --> 13:00.362
-...anything after.
-And then a...

13:00.988 --> 13:02.531
Another eagle.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.700
-Another eagle?
-Yeah, a... a...

13:04.784 --> 13:06.202
a second eagle

13:06.285 --> 13:08.788
flew in fast and, boom!

13:08.871 --> 13:10.873
Just knocked you over
and you slammed into that rock.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.042
No, no, no, that don't make no sense, son.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.503
-No?
-I mean, eagles are solitary creatures.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.963
Yes, that's what's so weird, right?

13:18.047 --> 13:19.632
This could only mean one thing.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.885
The eagle I was about to shoot was the...

13:23.469 --> 13:25.012
was the primal eagle

13:25.095 --> 13:27.890
foretold in the Yakama and Meskwaki myths.

13:27.973 --> 13:31.560
-What?
-The eagle that rules over all the eagles.

13:32.186 --> 13:35.064
Everything in my life
has led me to this moment, son.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.275
To kill the primal eagle!

13:38.359 --> 13:42.196
The soul of our country shall be purged
of all of our transgressions

13:42.279 --> 13:46.200
against all the native
and indigenous peoples of this land.

13:46.283 --> 13:48.327
That's the one thing it could mean?

13:48.410 --> 13:49.411
'Cause I--

13:49.495 --> 13:51.747
I feel like it could mean
a lot of different things.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.790
-Nope.
-And I feel like

13:53.874 --> 13:56.001
-you're just making up a bunch of stuff...
-Nope.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.754
...just to rationalize
your weird desire to kill eagles.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.214
No, sir.

14:00.297 --> 14:03.008
It's kind of strangely condescending
to Native Americans.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.470
Well, son,
we disagree on some of the specifics.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.264
But at the end of the day,

14:08.347 --> 14:10.850
we both agree what's most important.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.645
That so-called Eagly needs to die.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.438
We don't agree on that at all.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.523
We most certainly do.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.233
-No.
-Yes, we do.

14:19.316 --> 14:22.403
Economos. Bordeaux needs to see you. Now.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.116
What happened to you?

14:27.825 --> 14:29.743
My third eye's been opened, son.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.496
Ain't no way
that eagle's gonna hide from me now.

14:34.456 --> 14:35.499
Ads!

14:41.255 --> 14:42.256
Eagly!

14:46.051 --> 14:47.595
-We gotta go.
-Yo, what's going on?

14:47.678 --> 14:49.889
We gotta go fast.
I gotta move the dimensional portal.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.141
-You gotta what?
-We gotta go, please, Ads.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.392
What are you wearing?

14:53.475 --> 14:55.352
-Ads, fucking go!
-Okay, okay, where?

14:55.436 --> 14:56.812
Head towards Settlers' Hills.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.654
Vij. Yeah. I need you to pick up
some doors at Lowe's.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.576
Yeah? What do you want?

15:10.659 --> 15:11.952
What's your problem, Economos?

15:12.578 --> 15:13.579
Who can say?

15:13.662 --> 15:15.581
I couldn't possibly be upset
that I'm teamed up

15:15.664 --> 15:18.876
with an insane redneck bird-killer

15:18.959 --> 15:21.253
and some little kung fu Bulbasaur

15:21.337 --> 15:22.671
who once tried to murder me,

15:22.755 --> 15:25.633
while we try to arrest my friend.

15:25.716 --> 15:26.926
How wacky would that be?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.177
Well, get over it.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.095
I'm not getting paid
to deal with your shit.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.513
I think you kind of are.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.765
What?

15:32.848 --> 15:36.518
If you read my dossier,
you'd know I have social deficiencies

15:36.602 --> 15:39.647
that are worth dealing with
for all my other talents.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.733
So, you do kind of explicitly get paid

15:42.816 --> 15:44.443
to deal with my shit.

15:45.235 --> 15:48.739
You are one curmudgeonly motherfucker,
Ginger Cool.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.450
What the fuck?

15:51.533 --> 15:52.743
I told you not to call me that.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.703
-Motherfucker!
-Back off, Fleury.

15:55.245 --> 15:58.165
What kind of grown man spits
on another person?

15:58.248 --> 16:00.918
Is one of your talents
that you can hack the lock on this door?

16:01.001 --> 16:03.587
-If I had my equipment.
-Where is your equipment?

16:03.629 --> 16:04.755
It's in the mobile unit.

16:05.547 --> 16:06.966
Outside, 20 feet away.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.009
-No.
-No?

16:09.510 --> 16:11.929
-It's 30 feet.
-Go fucking get it, John.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.514
Yeah.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.022
We're all in this together, right?

16:27.152 --> 16:29.196
What did you mean
you have to move the portal?

16:29.279 --> 16:31.031
I mean, I gotta transfer the door
from my dad's house

16:31.156 --> 16:32.700
to where we're going,
if we make it in time.

16:32.783 --> 16:33.909
-Transfer?
-Yeah.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.036
I use this to do it.
I don't know if I still can.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.663
I was a kid the last time I did it.

16:37.746 --> 16:39.707
-A kid?
-Yeah. Moved it twice.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.126
Once when we found it in the woods
to my dad's trailer.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.253
I think my dad was afraid
it was dangerous,

16:44.336 --> 16:45.754
so he had me and Keith do it.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.214
-What a champ.
-Yeah.

16:47.297 --> 16:49.591
And then I did it again myself
when we moved to my dad's house.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.135
Your dad didn't make the portal?

16:51.760 --> 16:52.761
No way.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.888
I thought he was
some sort of super genius.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.849
You fucking kidding?
He flunked out of tenth grade.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.059
So, how'd he make
all them helmets and stuff?

16:59.560 --> 17:01.895
It's... complicated.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.817
-Yeah?
-Yeah, you're gonna get me arrested.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.111
I almost killed a guy
while saving Eagly's life.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.320
-What? How?
-It's not important.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.366
I'm about to go in there
and pick the lock on that closet door.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.326
Economos, I need you to stall them
for a little bit.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.787
-There isn't time.
-Just a little bit.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.414
Okay? All right?

17:20.497 --> 17:21.832
I'll try, okay?

17:21.915 --> 17:23.208
Fuck! I--

17:23.876 --> 17:25.377
Bordeaux sent me out here to help.

17:25.461 --> 17:29.506
Yeah, I don't need help.
I just... need this thing, okay?

17:33.385 --> 17:34.386
Fuck.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.096
What's so important about this door?

17:37.306 --> 17:38.307
Okay.

17:39.516 --> 17:40.601
Six months ago, right?

17:40.684 --> 17:42.269
I'm fucking around in there with Eagly.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.188
Just letting him fly around.
It's cold outside.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.231
He disappears for a minute.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.942
And I go running after him.
I'm yelling, screaming for him.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.027
I find him.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.197
He's by a door that's not mine,
but he's squawking at it.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.366
And then I realize the lock
is exactly like mine.

17:56.450 --> 17:59.286
And weirder, it's got a rack
of Peacemaker helmets next to it.

17:59.369 --> 18:00.370
What?

18:01.789 --> 18:03.624
I don't know why,
but I tried my dad's code.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.209
It worked.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.337
-So, I went in and...
-Wow.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.633
...my dad was there alive.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.803
Chris. This is like
after your father died.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.262
-It's not.
-You saw him then.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.139
-It's not the same.
-Those visions, they haunted you.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.849
They messed with you. I was worried, bro.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.143
It's... It's not the same, okay?

18:23.227 --> 18:25.521
This isn't my mind playing tricks on me,
all right?

18:25.604 --> 18:28.857
It's one of the 99 doorways
to other dimensions in there.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.985
And it leads to a parallel world
that's almost exactly like ours,

18:32.486 --> 18:33.487
but it's better.

18:34.029 --> 18:35.030
-Better?
-Yeah.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.198
It's not just my dad.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.492
It's Keith.

18:39.576 --> 18:40.661
He's alive.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.082
We're best friends. Him and my dad.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.543
All three of us.
We fight crime together. They...

18:48.043 --> 18:49.378
They call us the Top Trio.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.338
-The Top Trio?
-Yeah.

18:52.047 --> 18:53.090
There's murals.

18:55.425 --> 18:56.844
Wait, this is it. Make a left.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.404
-What is this place?
-It belonged to my grandfather.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.406
We used to come up here
with my dad when we hunted.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.120
There's fucking spiders everywhere.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.872
Adrian would love this.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.958
-Goddamn it.
-Shit!

19:29.626 --> 19:30.627
Okay.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.343
There's different ways to crack this code.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.012
Which way's best?

19:44.850 --> 19:45.893
You don't know?

19:46.768 --> 19:49.146
I'm trying to think through
the various possibilities.

19:49.813 --> 19:52.441
Didn't you hack into the CIA
when you were 14?

19:52.524 --> 19:54.610
I did. That's how I got recruited.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.695
-Yeah.
-And you can't hack this?

19:57.654 --> 20:00.574
I can. I just want
to find the best possible way.

20:00.657 --> 20:02.951
And I got caught hacking into the CIA.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.330
And I promised myself
I would never make that mistake again.

20:06.413 --> 20:07.664
Quit stalling, John.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.460
I'm not stalling. That's a f...

20:12.252 --> 20:13.754
That's just a weird thing to say to a--

20:13.879 --> 20:15.297
Just do whatever way is best.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.381
Fine.

20:28.477 --> 20:29.728
I'm gonna use this thing.

20:30.437 --> 20:31.521
Great.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.065
This is a...

20:33.148 --> 20:34.775
This is a good thing to...

20:35.484 --> 20:36.568
to use.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.950
I just plug it in.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.118
I mean, obviously, it's not a wireless.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.746
I just gotta hook up the leads to...

20:49.706 --> 20:50.707
Yeah.

20:58.131 --> 21:01.176
I just have to... hit this switch.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.185
Whoa! Whoa.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.395
What?

21:11.478 --> 21:13.939
-You guys hear a cat?
-A cat?

21:14.022 --> 21:15.941
Yeah, it sounds like a kitten crying out.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.986
I'm worried it might be stuck in a drawer.
Should we check all the--

21:19.069 --> 21:21.321
I don't care if there's a cat in a drawer.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.116
Okay. Callous.

21:24.199 --> 21:25.534
-Just open it, Economos!
-Open the door!

21:25.617 --> 21:26.952
Just do it, asshole.

21:27.869 --> 21:28.870
Okay, fine.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.291
As long as we just go back
and get the cat afterwards.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.336
This is the part I'm not so sure about.

21:40.924 --> 21:41.925
Whoa!

21:56.523 --> 21:58.066
Okay, here's where
I need you to go outside.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.359
-Why?
-Just do it.

21:59.860 --> 22:00.986
I'll be right behind you.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.341
What the fuck?

23:14.434 --> 23:15.644
Shit!

23:21.024 --> 23:22.859
Is that what you wanted it to do?

23:23.902 --> 23:24.903
Maybe.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.042
Whoa.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.674
General, Sasha Bordeaux is on line one.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.218
Sasha.

23:49.386 --> 23:50.429
Nothing?

23:52.347 --> 23:55.350
Why would he have a lock like that
on a closet with old sweaters?

23:57.227 --> 23:58.270
Right.

23:59.229 --> 24:02.524
Jeannie, get me an address
for Emilia Harcourt.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.741
Hey, kid.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.701
General, I--

24:54.784 --> 24:57.287
You do not have to call me General.
It's Rick, you know that.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.414
Rick. Right.

25:00.707 --> 25:01.708
Mind if I come in?

25:02.501 --> 25:03.793
Of course, sir.

25:08.381 --> 25:09.508
You doing okay?

25:10.550 --> 25:11.593
Yes, sir. You?

25:12.093 --> 25:13.094
Yeah.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.846
Heard you were injured a while back.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.225
Yeah, I broke my back. Waller's bullshit.

25:18.308 --> 25:21.186
Right. Congratulations on the promotion.

25:21.728 --> 25:22.854
Director.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.943
-You want some coffee, or...
-Sure.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.612
-A smidge of milk, no sugar?
-Yeah.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.614
And yet you can't remember
to call me Rick.

25:45.919 --> 25:48.755
You remember what you told me
after the funeral?

25:54.177 --> 25:56.096
-Sir.
-Rick.

25:57.764 --> 25:58.807
Rick.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.561
At the end of the day,
Smith killed your son

26:02.644 --> 26:04.688
because Waller ordered him to.

26:04.771 --> 26:07.941
Yeah, me in Pokolistan,
you and Ricky in Corto Maltese,

26:08.024 --> 26:10.694
we all defied Waller's orders
when she went too far.

26:10.777 --> 26:11.820
Yeah.

26:12.445 --> 26:13.697
I'm not judging you.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.448
I'm sure you miss Ricky, too.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.996
Can't imagine you flew across the country
to talk about your son, General.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.123
No.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.001
So, you know...

26:26.751 --> 26:28.211
you have been black-booked?

26:32.090 --> 26:34.009
Yeah, I was fairly certain
that was the case.

26:34.759 --> 26:35.760
It is.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.054
Waller did it?

26:39.222 --> 26:40.557
On her way out the door, yeah.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.895
So, I can't be hired
by any of the intelligence agencies

26:45.979 --> 26:47.105
for the rest of my life.

26:47.188 --> 26:48.565
That's what it means, yeah.

26:49.065 --> 26:50.108
Fucking...

26:51.776 --> 26:52.777
That's--

26:52.861 --> 26:54.654
That is fucking bullshit,

26:55.155 --> 26:57.324
-to be honest, General.
-I know.

26:57.407 --> 27:00.910
I was one among five agents
who eradicated an alien threat,

27:00.994 --> 27:02.203
saving countless lives,

27:02.287 --> 27:05.707
and I nearly lost my life in the process.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.792
I had nothing to do
with Amanda Waller's daughter

27:07.876 --> 27:09.544
outing her on national TV.

27:09.628 --> 27:13.548
Had Agent Adebayo asked my advice,
I would have strongly advised against it

27:13.632 --> 27:17.177
and offered other potential solutions
for keeping Agent Smith out of prison.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.137
So, I have no fucking idea

27:19.846 --> 27:21.765
why I am the one being black-booked here.

27:22.557 --> 27:23.808
You know Waller, kid.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.810
Woman can hold a grudge.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.897
She needed to blame somebody
for corrupting her daughter,

27:28.980 --> 27:31.066
and, rightly or wrongly, that fell on you.

27:31.149 --> 27:34.861
So, my 18 years of service
to my country means fucking nothing?

27:34.944 --> 27:37.197
Don't tell me you were in this
for the accolades, Emilia.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.074
Accolades, I can live without.

27:39.157 --> 27:42.452
I'd rather not do without my utilities,
which are about to be shut off.

27:42.535 --> 27:43.536
That's why I'm here.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.708
I'm thinking there may be a way
for you to get back

27:48.792 --> 27:50.377
in the good graces of the U.S. government.

27:51.711 --> 27:52.837
Anything.

27:53.546 --> 27:55.090
You have to bring us Peacemaker.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.354
My ad just came out in Pro Soldier.

28:10.063 --> 28:11.898
-Pro Soldier?
-That's right.

28:11.981 --> 28:14.776
Now, I'm just waiting for the calls
to start rolling in.

28:16.444 --> 28:18.029
Ads, Pro Soldier is a scam.

28:18.113 --> 28:20.573
-What?
-Yeah, nobody reads it.

28:20.657 --> 28:22.117
They make all their money off...

28:22.659 --> 28:24.244
wannabe mercenaries
buying their advertising.

28:24.327 --> 28:25.620
How many copies they sell?

28:25.704 --> 28:28.206
-I don't know, like, 12?
-Thousand?

28:28.707 --> 28:29.708
No.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.669
-Twelve hundred?
-Nope. You see where this is going?

28:32.752 --> 28:35.296
-Fuck!
-Yeah. Twelve.

28:35.797 --> 28:37.966
I know all the guys who read it,
and they're not hiring anybody.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.176
They're just watching
the Game Show Network,

28:40.260 --> 28:42.846
collecting their urine in jars,
posting on psoriasis Reddit threads.

28:42.929 --> 28:44.597
I get it. I get it.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.850
Yeah. I'm sorry.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.230
-Is there a you in there?
-What?

28:53.106 --> 28:55.483
You say there's your dad,
there's your brother,

28:55.567 --> 28:57.694
but is there a you in there?

29:00.780 --> 29:02.031
I got kinda fucked up.

29:02.615 --> 29:03.616
How?

29:04.784 --> 29:06.119
Well, I didn't mean to, you know.

29:06.202 --> 29:07.287
Mean to what?

29:08.371 --> 29:09.414
Kill him.

29:10.874 --> 29:13.793
You killed your own self
from a parallel dimension?

29:13.877 --> 29:16.838
It was self-defense. He was gonna kill me.
He found me in his room.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.006
Doing what?

29:19.048 --> 29:22.177
Looking at a picture of me
and Emilia Harcourt, like, in love.

29:23.553 --> 29:25.430
Back the fuck up.

29:25.513 --> 29:27.223
She's dating Rick Flag Junior,
who's still alive,

29:27.307 --> 29:28.808
but really still in love with me.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.894
Rick Flag Junior is in love with you?

29:30.977 --> 29:33.354
-No! No, Harcourt.
-Wait, okay.

29:33.438 --> 29:37.317
This is becoming
some fucked-up Twilight Zone shit.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.485
Yeah, right.

29:38.568 --> 29:41.404
You ever thought that maybe
there ain't another dimension at all?

29:41.488 --> 29:42.989
-What?
-Like, maybe you walk

29:43.072 --> 29:45.700
through that door in there
and you're in some sort of world

29:45.784 --> 29:49.621
that messes with your mind
and gives you whatever it is you wanted,

29:49.704 --> 29:51.080
but none of it's real.

29:52.624 --> 29:53.917
No, I'm pretty sure it's real.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.752
At the end of the day, does it matter?

29:55.835 --> 29:57.212
-Yeah.
-Why?

29:58.755 --> 30:00.673
You can't be thinking
about going back in there.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.383
-I have to.
-Why?

30:02.467 --> 30:04.010
First off, my brother, okay?

30:04.844 --> 30:07.263
Losing him as a kid,
that was the worst moment of my life.

30:07.764 --> 30:09.057
Now, he's gonna lose me if I don't--

30:09.140 --> 30:11.643
He already lost his brother
if you killed him, Chris.

30:11.726 --> 30:13.645
-You don't understand.
-Maybe I do.

30:13.728 --> 30:15.563
I owe Emilia
an explanation about something.

30:15.647 --> 30:16.648
About what?

30:16.731 --> 30:19.025
Whether or not I wanna
explore a relationship with her.

30:19.526 --> 30:20.527
What?

30:20.610 --> 30:22.111
I'm not just gonna
fucking stand the girl up.

30:22.195 --> 30:23.655
She's damaged enough.
He cheated on her.

30:23.738 --> 30:26.908
Dude, if it's real,
which I still very much doubt,

30:26.991 --> 30:28.618
she thinks you're somebody else.

30:28.701 --> 30:30.203
No, not really. We have the same DNA.

30:30.286 --> 30:32.747
-I passed a fucking eye test.
-What's an eye test?

30:32.831 --> 30:34.290
Where they put that thing over your eye!

30:34.374 --> 30:36.793
-Like at the airport?
-Yes. Yeah.

30:37.252 --> 30:39.337
He's like me, except more of a dick

30:39.379 --> 30:41.965
-with worse taste in clothes.
-I find that hard to believe.

30:42.048 --> 30:43.424
Look what I'm wearing!

30:43.508 --> 30:46.344
Looks like a Saudi prince vomited
his fucking dining room all over me.

30:46.427 --> 30:48.930
-You're wearing his clothes?
-You think I bought this, Ads?

30:50.014 --> 30:51.057
That's fucking hateful.

30:51.558 --> 30:55.311
Chris, no matter
how green the grass is over there,

30:55.395 --> 30:59.816
our biggest problems in life are the ones
that we carry within ourselves.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.734
Everything else evens out.

31:01.818 --> 31:04.904
This is where God put you.
You belong here.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.366
-Maybe I don't.
-Why?

31:08.950 --> 31:10.702
Maybe the universe fucked up, Ads,
you know?

31:10.785 --> 31:12.203
You know, maybe I belong in there,

31:12.287 --> 31:14.372
and my asshole doppelganger belongs here.

31:14.455 --> 31:17.041
But some fucking cosmic occurrence
switched us.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.962
So, I end up in the dark dimension
where I can't catch a fucking break.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.798
He ends up
in the land of goodness and light

31:23.882 --> 31:25.383
with a brother who's still alive

31:25.466 --> 31:27.051
and a father who fucking loves him.

31:27.635 --> 31:28.678
The good us.

31:29.470 --> 31:30.722
Where I'm a fucking hero.

31:32.765 --> 31:34.309
It don't feel right, Chris.

31:36.019 --> 31:38.187
P-- P-- P-- Peacemaker!

31:38.897 --> 31:39.898
Hey, Ads.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.107
Hey, Adrian.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.861
I got some doors and hinges,
just like you asked.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.405
Quantum Unfolding Chamber?

31:47.906 --> 31:48.948
Sick.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.200
I've been in there
a bunch of times, you know,

31:51.284 --> 31:52.368
it's best-friend stuff.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.454
And I bet there's another me
in there somewhere.

31:54.537 --> 31:56.623
-Don't you think?
-I don't know, Adrian.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.666
Let's see if we can fit
one of those doors on here.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.035
Fu--

32:56.849 --> 32:59.644
-Vij, I need to borrow your ride.
-Where are you going?

33:00.186 --> 33:01.270
To see Harcourt.

33:03.815 --> 33:04.899
Is that safe?

33:05.608 --> 33:08.277
I need her to answer a question
before I know what to do next.

33:13.741 --> 33:14.867
Take the phone.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.869
I don't trust him. Watch him.

33:28.256 --> 33:29.590
Did you find anything out?

33:31.092 --> 33:34.804
Emilia, this is your one shot
getting back in the good graces of ARGUS.

33:34.887 --> 33:36.180
This is bullshit.

33:36.764 --> 33:38.891
-I don't deserve this and neither does he.
-Emilia.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.102
I'm going to meet him now.

33:42.603 --> 33:44.772
Kupperberg Park, at Hartley and Vermont.

33:45.648 --> 33:48.484
I'll keep him occupied and distracted,
and then you come in.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.653
And it better be more
than just these two bozos.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.238
These what?

33:53.906 --> 33:56.075
You're not taking
the Peacemaker down alone.

33:56.784 --> 33:58.077
We'll have everyone there.

34:00.496 --> 34:02.999
You're doing the right thing, Emilia.

34:04.292 --> 34:05.376
I know I am.

36:08.291 --> 36:09.834
Settlers' Hills.

36:11.335 --> 36:13.588
I got you, motherfucker.

37:49.517 --> 37:50.810
Eagle droppings.

37:57.817 --> 38:00.945
Four days old.
Hints of cold cuts, tater chips.

38:01.028 --> 38:03.281
-No.
-I get hints of peppermint,

38:03.364 --> 38:05.950
SPAM, Twizzlers. M&Ms.

38:06.033 --> 38:07.952
Fruity Pebbles, and...

38:08.035 --> 38:09.203
-And...
-I... I get it.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.663
...protein powder. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:11.455 --> 38:12.498
Tikka masala.

38:12.581 --> 38:14.041
Come on, man, you can't really tell.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.710
Lima beans, pad Thai,

38:16.335 --> 38:17.378
A-5 Wagyu.

38:17.461 --> 38:18.754
-He ate all that...
-Yeah.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.089
...since his fucking last shit?

38:21.257 --> 38:22.550
Beluga caviar.

38:22.633 --> 38:25.261
There's no fucking way
you know what beluga caviar tastes like.

38:25.344 --> 38:26.595
Oh, my God.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.639
That eagle eats better than I do.
