00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.557
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.977
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES.

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:12.655
{\an8}FEBRUARY 16, 2002

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.700
{\an8}INTERROGATION ROOM,
WOONGSAN POLICE STATION

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:19.162
{\an8}We first met
at the public health center, didn't we?

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:23.291
{\an8}I was there to check
Song Byeong-cheol's body.

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:28.755
{\an8}All the onlookers on site

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:30.882
{\an8}had terrified looks on their faces.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:32.884
{\an8}However,

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:37.722
{\an8}there was one young woman
with a twinkle in her eyes

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:40.683
{\an8}as she observed the crime scene.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.271
{\an8}In front of the bathhouse,

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:48.608
and in front of Sataek Apartments,

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:50.443
you had the same look,

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:53.279
every time I saw you.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.532
I began to wonder…

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:58.743
…why you were like that.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.247
So it's just speculation.

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.207
That is why I started

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.751
to just follow you around.

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:07.877
Really?

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:18.138
A hairpin that resembles
the one you always wore

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.056
was discovered

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.558
at the crime scene.

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:23.893
I don't see yours now.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:26.479
Did you lose it?

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:39.617
As you walk down the street,

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:43.997
you see a man drag his wife
to the front of their home to beat her up.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.042
It's a common sight in these parts.

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:51.170
So you stop the man,

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:53.506
and help the terrified woman.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.632
Even after all that,

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.553
you continue circling the area,
refusing to leave.

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:02.307
Ring, ring.

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.357
You were like that every time I saw you.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.276
Nothing better to do?

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.069
Maybe you had time to waste?

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.364
For what reason?

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.700
I grew curious.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.494
I wondered what kind of person you were.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.665
I just kept watching you from afar.

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:43.431
The first condition involving my son
is the most important.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.269
Please change his name,
including his surname.

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.442
This is unreasonable,

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.903
and beyond my authority.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:59.614
Then, pass it along
to the person with that authority.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:08.206
I lost it on the beach.

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:11.334
Also, Detective Choi, these hairpins are

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:15.088
readily available at Mimi's General Store
near the marketplace.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.297
The very same ones.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.592
The big ones cost 2,000 won,
small ones 1,000 won.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.557
And there's one more thing.

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:33.147
I am going to need you
to look after Jeong-ho, my son,

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.526
until he reaches adulthood.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:37.610
Pardon?

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.488
"The inherent compassion
of the human heart."

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:46.995
Humans have the ability to show sympathy
to a complete stranger,

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.955
fueled by a sense of tender mercy.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.377
That's what I hear.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.215
I want you to instill
that sensibility in Jeong-ho.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:01.718
Help me

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:03.636
make that child

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:06.639
take after you.

00:05:30.788 --> 00:05:31.873
I was…

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:35.918
I apologize.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:38.755
I was under the impression
his mother had passed.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.841
You weren't wrong.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:45.928
I am dead to him.

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.517
It has been six hours already.

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:53.728
She was after Seo Gu-wan.

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.857
How did Jeong I-shin
find out about that hospital?

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.736
She had been there before
and she knows me well.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:06.407
She probably assumed
I would try to sequester him.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.036
Seo Gu-wan!

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.417
How could I be so dumb?

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:21.089
I never thought Jeong I-shin
would know how to drive.

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:22.924
Damn it.

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:26.427
How could I have known
so little about her?

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.055
If she had killed Seo,

00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:31.224
that means she fled
the Gwanghyeon-dong crime scene,

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:33.267
and found refuge somewhere.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:37.230
Where could she have gone?

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:51.452
It was abandoned about 1 km away
from the crash site.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:54.205
The memory card from the dashcam
is nowhere to be found.

00:06:54.288 --> 00:06:55.832
The vehicle was reported stolen

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:59.085
near Gwanghyeon Jeil Hospital
around 10 p.m. last night.

00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:12.640
Are you hungry, by any chance?
I could make some toast.

00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:13.599
Jung-yeon.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.601
- Hey, Su-yeol.
- Get back.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.233
Are you kidding me?

00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:25.278
The forgotten serial killer
everyone thought was dead

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:26.946
is perfectly alive
and running around out there.

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:29.240
And what happens
if this leads to another victim?

00:07:29.323 --> 00:07:30.825
To another incident?

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:33.035
Go and catch her right now.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.248
What do you think you're doing?

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.001
What are you doing here?

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:42.628
Don't say that.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.130
She told me everything.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.303
She knows I abandoned you
after your father died,

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:53.973
and that I lived in hiding
after using that bus accident

00:07:54.056 --> 00:07:56.017
and sham gravesite to fake my own death.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:58.144
Yes.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.189
I told her everything.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.036
Why did you come here?

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:17.371
She means nothing.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:20.458
I wanted to meet the person
who was by your side.

00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:22.168
I'm glad you did, Mother.

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.629
Su-yeol, sit.
You can talk sitting down.

00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:25.755
No.

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:27.507
She'll be leaving now.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.716
You are, right?

00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:30.468
Let's go.

00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:32.553
Su-yeol, don't.

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.264
She needs to go, Jung-yeon.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.225
I do.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:39.519
I should go.

00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:45.733
Wait, Mother…

00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:51.822
Go.

00:09:04.293 --> 00:09:05.962
Sir, what's the matter?

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:07.797
You look terrible.

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:09.590
Right.

00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:11.133
Gather around.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.103
Walk down.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.231
Slowly.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:40.788
There's something I've been meaning
to apologize to you all for.

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.338
SECURED JEONG. TRANSPORTING HER
TO CONTAINMENT RESIDENCE

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:54.927
Sulking to smiling in an instant.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.722
Did you invest in some bitcoins? Stocks?

00:09:57.805 --> 00:10:00.182
If he had invested in them,

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.601
he would remain sulking.

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:02.685
That's true.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.021
What?

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:07.231
You said you wanted
to apologize for something.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.568
It's just…

00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:14.780
I know the team had been pushing
for Detective Kim

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:17.408
to become the squad leader
for a long time now.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:21.037
I also believed that would be
the best for our team,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.496
and was going to promote her,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.165
but it didn't work out.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:29.170
I don't believe I have ever
officially apologized for that.

00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:32.548
Once we close this case,
I'll revisit that matter.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.843
Though you may be disappointed for now,

00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:40.681
I do hope you can support
Captain Cha for the time being.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:42.808
That's all.

00:10:50.107 --> 00:10:51.400
Menopause.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:52.443
Right.

00:10:55.696 --> 00:10:57.490
Goodness, Chief Choi…

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:13.589
Hold on.

00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:15.841
Thanks.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.009
And sorry.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.439
Are you worried about Jung-yeon?

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.274
You dare slither into my home

00:11:33.317 --> 00:11:34.819
after you kill Seo Gu-wan?

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:36.654
Seo Gu-wan

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:38.948
is dead?

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.741
You're going to play dumb?

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.535
You escaped,

00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:44.870
stole a car from the hospital,
and went to my place.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.664
The timeline and route align perfectly.

00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:49.166
I heard you don't want to have a baby.

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:51.919
Why?

00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:54.380
Are you afraid they will take after me?

00:11:59.677 --> 00:12:01.679
Tell me about
how you killed Seo Gu-wan first.

00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:04.306
How? Why'd you kill him?

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.101
You just decided to run him over?

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.895
He threatened you.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.939
That warrants death, just like your daddy.

00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:15.568
You…

00:12:15.651 --> 00:12:17.820
want me dead too, don't you?

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:19.905
You…

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:23.534
are just like your mother.

00:12:25.327 --> 00:12:26.996
Did you kill Seo Gu-wan?

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:28.914
You tell me first.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:29.874
How does it feel?

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.376
Are you sad

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.878
that he died?

00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:34.920
Do you pity him?

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:37.798
Or, perhaps…

00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:40.968
Are you not the slightest bit relieved?

00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:42.470
Now,

00:12:43.512 --> 00:12:44.763
it is safe.

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:46.307
Damn it.

00:12:57.568 --> 00:12:58.652
What did she say?

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.322
She refuses to fess up to it.

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:06.827
No one saw the driver inside the vehicle.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:09.079
She knows there is no evidence.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.458
But still, we managed to catch her.

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:14.293
You can go home now.

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:16.754
Sir.

00:13:16.837 --> 00:13:17.838
Yes?

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:22.510
Do I…

00:13:25.012 --> 00:13:26.472
take after her?

00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:29.183
What?

00:13:30.434 --> 00:13:31.477
That woman.

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:37.525
What are you talking about?

00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:39.777
You're nothing like her.

00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:48.762
Su-yeol.

00:14:50.347 --> 00:14:52.766
If it's about Jeong I-shin,
I'd rather not hear it.

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:55.895
It's about you.

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:03.736
You sometimes call out
for your mom in your sleep.

00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:04.820
You know that, right?

00:15:06.113 --> 00:15:07.990
It's a nightmare I have often.

00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:10.534
It didn't sound like a nightmare.

00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:15.539
You sounded like you missed her.

00:15:25.674 --> 00:15:26.675
Lie down comfortably.

00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:40.189
Sleep some more.

00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:42.066
Rest up.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.985
You need to catch more bad guys tomorrow.

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:16.392
TO MR. CHA SU-YEOL

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:18.727
- Is he dead?
- He's alive. He's talking.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.896
Should we call the police?
Stop recording.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.648
The ones here might need this as evidence.

00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:24.441
I'm scared. Let's go.

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:31.448
Do you want to do this while his blood
is still fresh on our hands?

00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:33.826
And what happens

00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:36.036
if someone else dies before we do?

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.204
What then?

00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:40.249
Hey.

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.002
What now?

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:49.425
Damn it.

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:50.509
Leave it.

00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:56.807
The M.O. mentioned in his webtoon is
identical to the method used in the crime.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.475
Even his place was a Mantis shrine.

00:16:58.559 --> 00:16:59.852
And we're just letting him go?

00:16:59.935 --> 00:17:01.895
Think about how that makes us look.

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:03.814
Forget interrogation.

00:17:03.897 --> 00:17:05.691
Never even got a proper look at his face.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.403
He and Chief Choi
are always so buddy-buddy,

00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:10.571
doing whatever they want.

00:17:10.654 --> 00:17:11.864
What choice do we have?

00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:15.451
He has a solid alibi.

00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:21.957
Are you just going to let him be?

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:25.794
What? Then, should I flop down
in front of the car to stop them?

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:27.546
No, I mean Captain Cha, that bastard.

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:30.841
I told you to watch your mouth.

00:17:32.801 --> 00:17:33.802
Jeez.

00:17:35.095 --> 00:17:38.182
Why so serious all of a sudden?
Are they friends or something?

00:17:44.104 --> 00:17:46.231
Is Mom doing okay?

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.983
I can't comment on that.

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.360
You know my situation.

00:17:55.407 --> 00:17:58.077
But I'm really curious about something.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.162
Do you really not remember?

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:03.707
How we used to go to the beach
with her when we were little?

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:08.337
I don't.

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:09.797
Really?

00:18:15.302 --> 00:18:16.595
That makes me sad.

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:18.972
So sad.

00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:23.143
There we go.

00:18:24.394 --> 00:18:25.395
Cheers.

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:32.736
We have all your favorites here, Ji-an.

00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:36.323
Ji-an, I know you've had
a challenging workload recently.

00:18:36.406 --> 00:18:37.449
Eat up and recharge.

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:40.452
I appreciate you treating me
to all these delicious treats,

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:43.580
but why are you treating me?
Park Min-jae was freed already.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.502
You know, it seems you've gotten
pretty lazy since making sergeant.

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:50.838
I mean, are all freed people innocent?

00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:52.714
Can we rule him out of the case now?

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.007
Dig into him properly.

00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:56.552
Internet history, social media,

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:58.720
and the apps he's subscribed to.
Check everything.

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:01.807
I'm sure he's hiding something.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.142
You know about my sixth sense.

00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:05.686
My sixth sense is tingling right now.

00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:07.146
Does Captain Cha know about this?

00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:09.940
Yeah, Captain Cha…

00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:13.443
Come on now.

00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:14.403
Dearest Ji-an.

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:16.530
Don't be like that. Just help me out here.

00:19:16.613 --> 00:19:17.781
Come on.

00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:28.458
SEONGSIN PNP PRINTING

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:35.007
Go on. Get out.

00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:38.468
Come on now.

00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:42.472
You drove me here
because you had something to say.

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:49.188
You…

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:52.357
are still a prime suspect in this case.

00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:55.986
You must update me
if you ever decide to move

00:19:56.069 --> 00:19:57.446
or travel long-distance.

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:01.074
Changing the subject, I see.

00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:03.535
Don't worry.

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:07.080
I won't tell anyone about you and Mom.

00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:14.588
This detective agency would crumble
if I weren't acutely perceptive.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:20.385
And what sort of friendly officer
drives you home after questioning?

00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:23.639
I know you did to give me
that warning for my sake.

00:20:28.685 --> 00:20:30.020
Bro.

00:20:30.812 --> 00:20:31.939
You know my dad, right?

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:35.525
The only childhood memories I have
are of him beating me up.

00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:39.821
But I woke up one day…

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:44.034
and found myself beating him up.

00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:52.209
Time is a very scary thing.

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:55.587
The man whom I was once terrified of

00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:58.799
has become someone
I have to take care of now.

00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:00.634
Mom may have become

00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:04.304
someone you have to take care of now.

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:07.975
A lot of time has passed.

00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:11.853
I'm just saying.

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:15.983
When that woman…

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:20.487
was there…

00:21:22.155 --> 00:21:23.282
that night.

00:21:25.867 --> 00:21:27.327
Do you think she was there

00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:29.705
to kill your dad for your sake?

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:35.752
Did Mom say that?

00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:37.337
That's not what happened.

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:40.340
She just killed those people
because she wanted to.

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:42.676
She wanted to kill,
but she couldn't just go out

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:44.261
and murder random people.

00:21:44.344 --> 00:21:46.847
That's why she went out of her way
to find miscreants to kill.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.181
And she rationalizes it

00:21:49.057 --> 00:21:51.393
by saying those people deserved to die.

00:21:53.061 --> 00:21:55.814
It's all for her sake, not yours.

00:21:58.066 --> 00:21:59.401
So…

00:22:01.194 --> 00:22:02.904
just forget about that woman.

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:05.490
I don't think I can see it that way.

00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:14.541
I'm leaving. Get out.

00:22:16.626 --> 00:22:19.296
Come on, Bro. Please…

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:23.842
Mom definitely loved you.

00:22:24.384 --> 00:22:27.054
Why do you refuse to accept that?

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:30.599
Why do you keep pretending like
that never happened?

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:32.893
And whatever she did,

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.895
she's still your mom.

00:22:35.937 --> 00:22:37.064
Get out.

00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:41.318
Damn it.

00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:46.490
You two are exactly alike.

00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:55.624
Hey.

00:22:57.292 --> 00:22:58.293
Say that again.

00:22:58.376 --> 00:23:00.420
You're rationalizing too.

00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:02.798
You're going out of your way
to demonize her.

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:05.008
Did you forget how many people she killed?

00:23:05.092 --> 00:23:06.718
That's not who she was with me!

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.805
Nor was she like that with you.

00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:10.889
Bro.

00:23:11.848 --> 00:23:13.100
Just be honest.

00:23:13.183 --> 00:23:15.143
You missed her.

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:17.062
But you can't admit it. Why?

00:23:17.646 --> 00:23:19.272
Because missing someone
who abandoned you

00:23:19.356 --> 00:23:20.899
only leads you to more suffering.

00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:24.069
That's why you make her out
to be someone you can't miss.

00:23:24.152 --> 00:23:25.821
You cast her as the devil.

00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:27.030
But you know what?

00:23:27.531 --> 00:23:29.074
That's what you call rationalization.

00:23:29.157 --> 00:23:31.409
Mom's not the one rationalizing, you are.

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:34.746
That's some real bullshit.

00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:37.165
So what if she's my mom?

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:39.292
Does that mean
she can commit heinous murders,

00:23:39.376 --> 00:23:40.335
but I'm required

00:23:40.418 --> 00:23:43.380
to empathize, cherish, and miss her
just because she's my mom?

00:23:44.047 --> 00:23:45.048
Am I?

00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:47.509
You think that's humane?

00:23:49.719 --> 00:23:51.012
Get your shit together.

00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:52.806
Okay?

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:56.977
Stop idolizing
that despicable serial killer…

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.690
and try to live a normal life.

00:24:33.388 --> 00:24:34.639
Catch my son's killer!

00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:37.767
All you do is waste taxpayers' money.

00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:38.727
Jesus.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:39.936
Hurry up and drive.

00:24:42.189 --> 00:24:43.273
What a mess.

00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:48.653
This case may end up
going to headquarters.

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:50.322
Jeong I-shin

00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:53.575
only agreed to consult with Captain Cha.

00:24:54.284 --> 00:24:55.827
If a new team takes over--

00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:56.995
What about her?

00:24:57.078 --> 00:24:59.080
After I jumped through hoops
to get her for you,

00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:01.541
you couldn't even get me
a composite sketch.

00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:04.211
I also need something
to show off in front of the higher-ups.

00:25:04.294 --> 00:25:06.671
If a new team takes over,
it'll just lead to more people

00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:08.423
finding out about Jeong's situation.

00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:10.800
Please give us a little more time.

00:25:10.884 --> 00:25:14.888
There's no one else who understands
the copycat killer better than her.

00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:17.974
You'd better not be
empty-handed next time.

00:25:18.642 --> 00:25:19.768
Thank you, sir.

00:25:20.727 --> 00:25:24.940
The culprit even knows
that Jeong I-shin killed her husband.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.109
That wasn't even revealed
to the police 23 years ago.

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:30.445
I guess… maybe Seo Gu-wan?

00:25:31.071 --> 00:25:32.405
He seemed to have an inkling,

00:25:32.489 --> 00:25:34.950
but considering he kept
no other record of it,

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:36.660
I don't think he knew much.

00:25:36.743 --> 00:25:39.913
If Seo did know everything,

00:25:39.996 --> 00:25:43.124
he would've at least hung
a picture of my father under "zero."

00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:47.254
Who could it be?

00:25:48.255 --> 00:25:49.256
How do they know

00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:52.342
everything about Jeong I-shin's crimes?

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:55.303
It must be someone

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:58.139
who Jeong intentionally shared
her secret past with.

00:25:59.015 --> 00:26:01.434
I already checked with Anwon Prison.

00:26:02.102 --> 00:26:04.688
The only one
who had contact with her was Seo.

00:26:04.771 --> 00:26:08.650
And the only people she ever
wrote letters to or communicated with

00:26:08.733 --> 00:26:10.819
were you and Seo Gu-wan

00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:12.529
for the past 23 years.

00:26:12.612 --> 00:26:16.449
Then someone else must have known
the truth, including that incident.

00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:23.957
Her first murder
where she killed her husband.

00:26:24.541 --> 00:26:26.042
Is there anyone else who would've

00:26:27.085 --> 00:26:28.128
known about that?

00:26:31.172 --> 00:26:32.173
Wait.

00:26:33.133 --> 00:26:35.635
There's that psychiatrist
who assessed her mental state

00:26:35.719 --> 00:26:38.096
immediately after she was arrested.

00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:40.390
She was on a business trip last time.

00:26:41.349 --> 00:26:42.475
That doctor?

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.439
Are you suggesting that the doctor
talked about Jeong to someone else?

00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:50.608
Breaking doctor-patient confidentiality
in the process?

00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:54.279
Even if she had, the healthcare laws…

00:26:56.072 --> 00:26:59.034
Damn it. I don't know.
We'll never get that warrant.

00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:03.371
Let's just go and see her.

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:04.706
What about the warrant?

00:27:05.874 --> 00:27:06.958
Hey.

00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:08.376
Su-yeol.

00:27:10.837 --> 00:27:13.506
{\an8}RAYEON CERAMIC STUDIO

00:27:38.406 --> 00:27:39.991
Hey, Min-jae.

00:27:41.743 --> 00:27:42.952
Hello.

00:27:43.036 --> 00:27:45.330
You must be here to see Ah-ra.

00:27:45.413 --> 00:27:46.998
- Yes.
- Come inside for a cup of tea.

00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:48.249
No, that won't be necessary.

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:50.627
Some shady guy
in the workplace of two lovely women?

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:51.961
That'd be just wrong.

00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:54.881
Go inside. It's cold.

00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:57.759
Wait, Min-jae.

00:27:57.842 --> 00:27:58.843
Yes?

00:28:02.055 --> 00:28:04.349
When Su-yeol was little
and living with his mother,

00:28:04.933 --> 00:28:06.935
what was their relationship like?

00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:12.107
Just your typical mother and son.

00:28:12.982 --> 00:28:15.402
Like adoring one another

00:28:15.902 --> 00:28:17.904
and protecting each other?

00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:21.282
Right.

00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:23.535
That was just everyday life for them,

00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:26.454
but from the outside, they looked happy.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.581
Something like that.

00:28:30.917 --> 00:28:32.710
- I should get going.
- Okay.

00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:44.764
{\an8}MIND LOVE PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

00:28:44.848 --> 00:28:45.849
{\an8}The thing is,

00:28:45.932 --> 00:28:48.977
{\an8}this would be an essential lead for us.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.938
Has Jeong I-shin ever discussed

00:28:52.021 --> 00:28:55.066
murdering her husband with you?

00:28:56.276 --> 00:28:58.445
Surely, you must be aware of the oath

00:28:58.528 --> 00:28:59.738
that physicians take.

00:29:01.656 --> 00:29:03.450
Yes, I am. But…

00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:08.037
{\an8}This is quite a crucial issue for us.

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:14.461
If, by chance, you divulged
such information to someone else--

00:29:14.544 --> 00:29:16.963
I have patients waiting.

00:29:20.216 --> 00:29:22.427
{\an8}Did you bring a warrant?

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:24.095
{\an8}Well, you see…

00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:28.099
{\an8}- Then, I think we're done here.
- I told you I was in pain! I'm in pain!

00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:30.477
{\an8}Don't worry. It happens sometimes.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.561
{\an8}I see.

00:29:33.646 --> 00:29:37.108
{\an8}- Excuse me for a moment.
- Should I have predicted I'd be sick?

00:29:38.026 --> 00:29:39.319
Nurse Park.

00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:44.365
Nurse Park, does he have
a history of treatment with us?

00:29:45.074 --> 00:29:47.994
- Sir, could you give me your name?
- I'm in so much pain!

00:29:48.578 --> 00:29:49.412
PATIENT THERAPY RECORDS

00:29:49.496 --> 00:29:52.415
Why do you want to know my name?

00:29:52.499 --> 00:29:54.459
That is my private data!

00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:56.461
This won't do.

00:29:56.544 --> 00:29:59.756
Call security right now.
And the police, if you must.

00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:03.009
Sir, you need to tell us
what's exactly bothering you.

00:30:03.092 --> 00:30:05.720
My head feels like it's splitting open.

00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:08.431
I'm in so much pain!

00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:10.391
I guess I have to come back

00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:12.519
with the proper documentation.

00:30:21.361 --> 00:30:23.238
My goodness.

00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:24.614
I really put on a show.

00:30:24.697 --> 00:30:27.408
If you stalled a bit more,
I could've copied everything.

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:30.119
Damn it.
Security just popped out of nowhere.

00:30:30.203 --> 00:30:32.789
Just imagine how it'd make me look
if I got caught by them.

00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:35.458
Well done.

00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:37.293
I hope we got something useful.

00:30:39.462 --> 00:30:43.341
It seems Jeong I-shin
did talk about her first murder.

00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:45.969
Even about how it was impulsive.

00:30:46.052 --> 00:30:47.136
But there's no way

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.973
for us to make the doctor talk about
who she shared that with.

00:30:50.056 --> 00:30:51.975
They won't issue a warrant for this.

00:30:52.642 --> 00:30:54.769
We also must consider the possibility

00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:57.647
that it wasn't her,
but someone else who stole these records.

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.607
- Let me see.
- Sure.

00:31:10.743 --> 00:31:12.036
- Sir.
- Yeah?

00:31:13.496 --> 00:31:14.747
Do you think this is right?

00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:15.915
What do you mean?

00:31:16.457 --> 00:31:18.293
You and I working alone like this.

00:31:19.127 --> 00:31:21.212
Maybe it'd be better for the investigation

00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:22.755
if we share

00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:25.425
everything about Jeong I-shin
with the team and get their help?

00:31:25.508 --> 00:31:26.718
You think

00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:29.762
they'd "help out" the captain
who's been lying to them this whole time?

00:31:30.763 --> 00:31:33.099
You're just setting yourself up
for your own downfall.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.271
You're not the only one suffering.

00:31:38.354 --> 00:31:40.231
This is hard on all of us.

00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:42.817
Us.

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.321
We'll be exposed eventually.

00:31:47.196 --> 00:31:48.615
And when that happens,

00:31:49.198 --> 00:31:52.327
remember Detective Kim
is a true police officer.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.579
She has a good command
of the team as well.

00:31:54.662 --> 00:31:56.748
I'm sure she'll do a good job.

00:31:59.167 --> 00:32:02.295
It ends with her talking
about her childhood.

00:32:02.378 --> 00:32:03.338
Sir.

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:04.923
What is this?

00:32:05.006 --> 00:32:06.424
I-shin's mother…

00:32:07.717 --> 00:32:10.136
So your maternal grandmother.

00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:13.097
It says she died
while Jeong I-shin watched.

00:32:21.856 --> 00:32:24.484
JUSIN CHURCH

00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:34.786
That night…

00:32:35.703 --> 00:32:36.913
Mom!

00:32:36.996 --> 00:32:38.331
…a fire broke out at our house.

00:32:39.916 --> 00:32:42.085
Her mother never made it out.

00:32:43.419 --> 00:32:47.465
When she heard
her mother cry out for help,

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.636
she tried to run in there to save her.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.473
I was scared.

00:32:56.099 --> 00:32:57.183
So scared.

00:32:58.393 --> 00:32:59.435
All I did

00:33:00.186 --> 00:33:02.146
was hold onto that girl and stop her

00:33:02.772 --> 00:33:04.232
from jumping into the fire.

00:33:05.274 --> 00:33:07.986
I held onto her for dear life
until the end.

00:33:09.696 --> 00:33:11.280
"I couldn't lose her too."

00:33:12.782 --> 00:33:15.827
That was the only thought on my mind.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.121
She…

00:33:19.706 --> 00:33:22.000
clawed at me as she thrashed and wailed.

00:33:23.209 --> 00:33:24.627
And after that day,

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.257
she shut me out.

00:33:31.384 --> 00:33:32.385
Maybe

00:33:33.052 --> 00:33:35.138
seeing that happen to her mother

00:33:36.097 --> 00:33:41.227
was what led her to commit
all those horrific deeds.

00:33:52.405 --> 00:33:53.740
It's all my fault.

00:33:54.532 --> 00:33:56.617
If I had jumped into the fire

00:33:56.701 --> 00:34:01.164
and just burned to death with her mother,

00:34:01.247 --> 00:34:04.459
then all those innocent people
wouldn't have…

00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:10.214
Pull yourself together.

00:34:10.798 --> 00:34:12.550
So you're bound to become a serial killer

00:34:12.633 --> 00:34:14.135
if you lose a parent in an accident?

00:34:15.011 --> 00:34:16.012
Then, what about me?

00:34:16.095 --> 00:34:18.347
No, that's not what I meant.

00:34:23.269 --> 00:34:24.270
I remember.

00:34:26.606 --> 00:34:28.149
The day that woman was arrested,

00:34:29.192 --> 00:34:32.445
I was alone at the police station.

00:34:38.367 --> 00:34:41.037
You must be Jeong-ho.

00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:49.504
I'm your grandpa from your mother's side.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.841
An old man I'd never met before showed up

00:34:55.343 --> 00:34:56.677
and hugged me tightly.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.305
Did I?

00:35:01.682 --> 00:35:02.892
I was raised

00:35:04.727 --> 00:35:07.647
by you and Chief Choi.

00:35:08.898 --> 00:35:11.818
Jeong Hyun-nam and Choi Jung-ho.

00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:16.030
You two are my parents.

00:35:21.577 --> 00:35:22.745
I don't want to.

00:35:26.249 --> 00:35:28.376
- I can't.
- You're okay.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.379
I'll be right by your side.

00:35:32.672 --> 00:35:35.049
Go on. It's not hard.

00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:37.135
- Captain.
- Yes?

00:35:37.218 --> 00:35:39.303
A courier just dropped this off for you.

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:41.639
What is it?

00:35:41.722 --> 00:35:43.015
No idea.

00:35:50.106 --> 00:35:51.023
{\an8}TO MR. CHA SU-YEOL

00:35:57.947 --> 00:36:00.825
It's a trending dating app called Amor.

00:36:01.534 --> 00:36:03.578
Park Min-jae is a subscriber.

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:07.039
He follows this woman named Jo-i,

00:36:07.123 --> 00:36:08.499
and she follows him back.

00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:11.502
Are those really her pictures?

00:36:11.586 --> 00:36:13.588
They look to be AI-generated.

00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:16.632
She could have a different face
or she could even be a man.

00:36:17.216 --> 00:36:18.217
So, what about her?

00:36:18.301 --> 00:36:21.304
Look at Jo-i's list of followers.

00:36:21.387 --> 00:36:23.222
Park wasn't the only one
she followed back.

00:36:23.306 --> 00:36:25.516
Jeong Won-sik, the first victim,

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.518
along with Kang Su-cheol, Yoo Si-hyeon,

00:36:28.102 --> 00:36:30.104
and even Kim Hyeon-u all followed Jo-i.

00:36:33.149 --> 00:36:36.068
No way. We got the bastard.

00:36:36.152 --> 00:36:37.778
We finally found the connection.
This--

00:36:37.862 --> 00:36:38.863
What's that?

00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:40.698
Well…

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.826
You punks.

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:44.911
Hold on a second.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.997
Come on. This is as good as done.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.999
We find the profile owner and arrest him.

00:36:50.082 --> 00:36:51.918
Why hand over a done deal to the captain?

00:36:52.001 --> 00:36:53.961
Hey, Bae Sung-gyu,
have you lost your mind?

00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:56.380
This is a murder case.

00:36:57.006 --> 00:36:58.549
Unity would barely be enough,

00:36:58.633 --> 00:37:00.593
and you're busy splitting us up?

00:37:00.676 --> 00:37:03.012
You agreed the captain
had a hidden agenda not too long ago.

00:37:03.095 --> 00:37:04.096
Everyone.

00:37:04.764 --> 00:37:05.765
I need you to see this.

00:37:23.783 --> 00:37:24.867
How did it get here?

00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:27.203
It was anonymously sent via courier.

00:37:27.286 --> 00:37:29.789
I delivered it to the captain
after security cleared it.

00:37:30.498 --> 00:37:33.000
The phone belonged to Kim Hyeon-u,
the Nodu Stream victim.

00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:34.377
That crazy son of a bitch.

00:37:37.296 --> 00:37:38.297
INCOMING
BLOCKED NUMBER

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:48.140
Hello?

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.394
Deliver the phone to that woman.

00:37:51.477 --> 00:37:52.728
You understand, right?

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:56.649
I'm having trouble hearing you.
Can you speak a little louder?

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.777
Don't pull any stupid shit.
I'll call you later.

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:08.619
"That woman"? What is he talking about?

00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:12.957
Well…

00:38:14.375 --> 00:38:15.376
Captain.

00:38:15.459 --> 00:38:17.461
Captain Cha, may I have a word?

00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:18.754
We need to talk.

00:38:19.588 --> 00:38:20.715
What the hell is this?

00:38:21.716 --> 00:38:23.009
Do we look like idiots to you?

00:38:23.092 --> 00:38:26.304
You two sneak off to whisper
about something every chance you get.

00:38:26.387 --> 00:38:28.806
If you actually see us as a team,
have the discussion here.

00:38:29.432 --> 00:38:32.393
Let's not do this.
I'll explain everything later.

00:38:33.102 --> 00:38:34.979
- Captain Cha.
- Hold on.

00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:54.832
Jeong I-shin…

00:38:56.792 --> 00:38:58.586
has been aiding our investigation.

00:38:58.669 --> 00:38:59.962
- Captain Cha.
- Chief Choi!

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:04.633
At this moment, we need to come together.

00:39:04.717 --> 00:39:07.553
The culprit wants
to speak to Jeong directly.

00:39:07.636 --> 00:39:09.221
Having them talk will lead to a clue.

00:39:09.305 --> 00:39:11.557
This is our chance to catch the culprit.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.851
We'll lose that chance
if we just do it alone.

00:39:13.934 --> 00:39:17.188
Then, all the intel Captain Cha
has brought us until now--

00:39:17.271 --> 00:39:19.815
The commissioner
wanted it kept confidential.

00:39:23.611 --> 00:39:24.653
I'm sorry.

00:39:25.279 --> 00:39:28.824
I'm also fully aware
that an apology won't be enough.

00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:31.994
After secretly hoarding all that intel,

00:39:32.078 --> 00:39:33.871
now you need us and ask for help?

00:39:33.954 --> 00:39:36.332
Unbelievable.
And you call yourself the captain?

00:39:37.166 --> 00:39:38.417
Damn it.

00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:42.296
I knew the moment I saw you…

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.923
Forget it.

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:47.635
Good luck to you two.

00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:55.059
Well?

00:39:55.142 --> 00:39:57.061
You want to stay here and be disrespected?

00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:01.190
Is that all?

00:40:06.779 --> 00:40:07.988
- And Jeong I-shin--
- I did it.

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:09.532
I ordered him to do it.

00:40:09.615 --> 00:40:10.866
I'm the one you should curse out.

00:40:12.493 --> 00:40:14.370
No one can know that we're working

00:40:14.453 --> 00:40:15.579
with the Mantis herself.

00:40:15.663 --> 00:40:17.331
If any of this gets leaked to the media,

00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:20.126
we'll all be done for. You know that.

00:40:20.209 --> 00:40:23.129
I know you're all upset,

00:40:23.212 --> 00:40:25.339
but curse me out and whatever else,
after we catch him.

00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:27.174
Did you not hear me, Mr. Cha?

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:30.136
I asked if you are hiding
anything else from us.

00:40:35.558 --> 00:40:37.768
No, I'm not.

00:40:48.904 --> 00:40:50.114
It's a dating app.

00:40:50.197 --> 00:40:51.157
A woman named Jo-i.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.701
All four victims followed her profile.

00:40:53.784 --> 00:40:55.369
- Detective Kim.
- Be quiet.

00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:56.787
Damn it.

00:40:56.871 --> 00:40:58.122
We're cracking the account.

00:40:58.205 --> 00:41:01.542
There's a good chance one of her followers
will be the next victim.

00:41:06.088 --> 00:41:07.214
Detective Kim.

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:09.800
Thank you.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.934
Finally, we get to meet her,

00:41:19.018 --> 00:41:20.686
the world-famous Mantis.

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:25.483
KIM NA-HEE

00:41:27.902 --> 00:41:28.903
Let's head out.

00:41:29.695 --> 00:41:30.905
Hyuk, can you grab my jacket?

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:32.656
Yes, sir.

00:41:38.787 --> 00:41:39.788
Hey, wait.

00:41:52.092 --> 00:41:54.303
You couldn't pick up one more?

00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:56.639
Not one redeeming quality.

00:42:26.335 --> 00:42:27.878
He's confident.

00:42:27.962 --> 00:42:30.506
He believes he'll never be caught.

00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:34.176
He originally replicated your M.O.
in the beginning,

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.637
but he has now started
adding his own touches,

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.931
like mirrors,

00:42:39.014 --> 00:42:42.476
to inflict greater pain on his victims,
flaunting his violent tendencies.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.478
Vanity and arrogance.

00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:47.856
You want to provoke those inclinations
to cause him to slip up.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.066
That's right.

00:42:54.113 --> 00:42:55.614
Great minds think alike.

00:42:57.616 --> 00:42:58.659
Where are we with Jo-i?

00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:04.623
The app is based overseas,
so it's taking some time.

00:43:04.707 --> 00:43:05.791
It'll be done soon.

00:43:09.795 --> 00:43:11.005
Ms. Jeong.

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:13.591
He'll be calling soon.

00:43:14.675 --> 00:43:16.260
This will be your chance

00:43:17.052 --> 00:43:19.388
to repay, even in part,
for the crimes you've committed.

00:43:36.196 --> 00:43:38.907
PARK MIN-JAE

00:43:38.991 --> 00:43:42.578
SEONGSIN PNP PRINTING

00:43:58.594 --> 00:44:01.347
Well, this is a surprise. I thought
you never wanted to see me again.

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:03.974
Mr. Park Min-jae. This is Choi Jung-ho.
We met last time.

00:44:04.058 --> 00:44:07.519
You use a dating app called Amor,
don't you?

00:44:07.603 --> 00:44:10.022
Yes, I do.

00:44:10.105 --> 00:44:11.523
By chance,

00:44:11.607 --> 00:44:14.568
have you ever chatted
with a woman named Jo-i?

00:44:14.652 --> 00:44:15.653
Jo-i?

00:44:17.196 --> 00:44:18.197
Oh, right.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.866
Yes, she said she was a fan of my webtoon.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.160
We never met in person, though.

00:44:23.243 --> 00:44:26.497
If she ever contacts you again,
please let us know immediately.

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:29.375
Especially if you ever get
the chance to meet her.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.294
But… why?

00:44:34.713 --> 00:44:35.714
Hold on.

00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:38.092
This must have something
to do with the case. Right?

00:44:39.468 --> 00:44:41.387
Wait. Hold on.

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:45.224
Can you let Su-yeol know
he should call me himself

00:44:45.766 --> 00:44:47.893
if he needs to talk to me in the future?

00:44:49.978 --> 00:44:50.979
All right.

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:52.981
What did he say?

00:44:54.274 --> 00:44:56.735
He said you should call him
yourself next time.

00:44:59.988 --> 00:45:01.323
He's calling.

00:45:11.792 --> 00:45:13.210
Let me see your face.

00:45:13.293 --> 00:45:15.587
I need to check
you're really Jeong I-shin.

00:45:17.756 --> 00:45:19.258
It's nice to meet you, Ms. Jeong.

00:45:20.801 --> 00:45:21.969
Why are you imitating me?

00:45:22.928 --> 00:45:24.054
I just want

00:45:24.138 --> 00:45:27.558
more people to know
about the things you have done.

00:45:27.641 --> 00:45:29.309
Don't you think it's fun?

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:30.394
The mirror

00:45:30.477 --> 00:45:31.854
was a nice touch.

00:45:33.021 --> 00:45:34.940
I only ever thought about torturing them

00:45:35.023 --> 00:45:37.276
and killing them.

00:45:38.068 --> 00:45:40.446
But you made them witness it
themselves until the end.

00:45:42.114 --> 00:45:43.657
It sounds like you have an audience.

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:47.202
I'm using a frequency converter,
so you won't be able to track me.

00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:51.665
What's next? That can't be the end.

00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:53.584
Today.

00:45:53.667 --> 00:45:55.294
When the final scene ends,

00:45:55.377 --> 00:45:56.837
so will his life.

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:02.509
I'm envious.

00:46:03.177 --> 00:46:05.137
It's been so long since I've had a taste.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.848
The inspiration behind all my performances

00:46:08.474 --> 00:46:11.101
comes from you, Mantis.

00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:12.478
CALL HAS BEEN DISCONNECTED

00:46:13.145 --> 00:46:15.272
Hold on. He said, "final scene."

00:46:15.355 --> 00:46:17.691
"Final scene."

00:46:18.358 --> 00:46:20.819
Does that make you think of anything?

00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:24.990
Movies. Plays. Like a performance.

00:46:25.073 --> 00:46:27.701
Take a look at the occupations
of Jo-i's followers.

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:34.750
KIM SEO-JUN

00:46:34.833 --> 00:46:37.711
Kim Seo-jun, one of her followers,
is an opera singer.

00:46:37.794 --> 00:46:39.004
Tosca.

00:46:39.087 --> 00:46:40.756
It's today at Gwangju Arts Center.

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:42.549
Let's go.

00:46:43.592 --> 00:46:44.801
That can't be it.

00:46:46.053 --> 00:46:48.639
That would be too easy.
He's got something up his sleeve.

00:46:48.722 --> 00:46:51.141
We need to check
if there's even the slightest doubt.

00:46:51.225 --> 00:46:52.309
And I'm sure

00:46:52.392 --> 00:46:54.895
Jo-i will also be cautious
with all the people around.

00:46:55.604 --> 00:46:57.272
He doesn't care about any of that.

00:46:58.774 --> 00:47:00.317
You must think like Jo-i.

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.401
That's how you catch him.

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:02.903
Or…

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:05.072
you could think like me.

00:47:26.927 --> 00:47:28.387
TOSCA, AN OPERA BY PUCCINI
TICKET BOX

00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:30.806
Hyuk, you guard the entrance.

00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:32.975
The rest can keep an eye
on the performers.

00:47:33.058 --> 00:47:35.102
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:40.607
{\an8}SCARPIA, BARITONE,
KIM SEO-JUN

00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:09.678
I wonder what I should do.

00:48:10.429 --> 00:48:12.139
Should I help Su-yeol out?

00:48:16.101 --> 00:48:17.477
Okay.

00:48:20.564 --> 00:48:22.774
Jo-i…

00:48:22.858 --> 00:48:24.651
{\an8}Hello.

00:48:33.952 --> 00:48:35.829
Please read it.

00:48:38.123 --> 00:48:39.207
{\an8}IT'S BEEN A WHILE

00:48:43.128 --> 00:48:45.505
"CAVARADOSSI" DRESSING ROOM
LEE SA-YA

00:48:48.216 --> 00:48:50.260
Excuse me. I'm with the police.

00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:57.434
Updates.

00:48:57.517 --> 00:48:59.728
The backstage corridor has been secured.

00:49:03.398 --> 00:49:06.526
Access restricted
from dressing rooms to the entrance.

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.695
Checking the audience members.

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:09.905
Nothing to report yet.

00:49:24.127 --> 00:49:26.046
The second act is almost over.

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:27.881
Kim Seo-jun doesn't appear
in the third act.

00:49:28.924 --> 00:49:30.884
He'll soon be stabbed
with the dagger on the table.

00:49:31.885 --> 00:49:33.720
Working on my webtoon.

00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:36.640
Even if no one is reading it. Send.

00:49:40.686 --> 00:49:44.981
YOU HAVE ME.
AM I NOT A PERSON? AM I AI?

00:49:45.065 --> 00:49:46.233
Sorry.

00:49:47.984 --> 00:49:49.444
Maybe.

00:49:52.239 --> 00:49:53.824
WHAT?

00:49:53.907 --> 00:49:55.409
How could I be sure

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:57.703
unless you're standing in front of me?

00:49:57.786 --> 00:49:59.996
The app might be using AI

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.582
to increase subscribers.

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:04.334
I think that sounds plausible.

00:50:09.965 --> 00:50:12.759
Come on. Take the bait. Go on.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:25.981
What?

00:50:30.444 --> 00:50:33.238
He's going to do it in front
of all these people watching?

00:50:34.489 --> 00:50:35.824
That's not the Mantis's style.

00:50:38.076 --> 00:50:39.161
But--

00:50:39.244 --> 00:50:40.328
A life is on the line.

00:50:41.496 --> 00:50:42.789
We have no other choice.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.172
Do you have stage access?

00:51:01.141 --> 00:51:03.226
Hello. I'm with the police.

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:06.062
I just need to check this.

00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:09.191
Keep up the good work.

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:30.253
HOW CAN I CLEAR MY NAME?

00:51:30.337 --> 00:51:32.297
Come here.

00:51:37.302 --> 00:51:39.387
SERIOUSLY?
THAT'S WHERE WE END UP?

00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:41.890
You said you were a fan of my work.

00:51:41.973 --> 00:51:44.810
This is your chance to be the first

00:51:44.893 --> 00:51:47.521
to read how my webtoon ends.

00:51:51.817 --> 00:51:53.693
Take the bait. Go on.

00:52:12.087 --> 00:52:13.463
Secure Kim Seo-jun.

00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:19.219
We will now have a 20-minute intermission.

00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:22.138
The performance will resume
in exactly 20 minutes.

00:52:22.222 --> 00:52:26.017
Please enjoy this break
and return to your seats promptly.

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:30.397
Please return to your seats on time
to ensure the show can run smoothly.

00:52:38.446 --> 00:52:39.865
Wait, where did Mr. Kim Seo-jun go?

00:52:39.948 --> 00:52:40.991
Where is he?

00:52:41.908 --> 00:52:42.951
Oh, he's gone.

00:52:43.034 --> 00:52:43.869
Who cares?

00:52:44.452 --> 00:52:45.370
What?

00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:48.748
Where's Kim Seo-jun?

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:51.918
He was just there, but he disappeared.

00:52:56.464 --> 00:52:57.674
Kim is not in the third act.

00:52:57.757 --> 00:52:59.301
We must spread out and find him.

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:04.764
Sir, it seems Kim left in a hurry
without even taking his makeup off,

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:06.600
and just a mask on his face.

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:15.483
He's nowhere to be found.

00:53:27.287 --> 00:53:28.663
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

00:53:31.249 --> 00:53:32.125
Okay!

00:53:32.208 --> 00:53:34.794
WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS?

00:53:34.878 --> 00:53:38.715
68 HYEON-RO, SEOYEON-DONG,
NAMGWANG-GU, GWANGJU

00:53:39.382 --> 00:53:40.342
I'LL BE THERE IN AN HOUR

00:53:40.425 --> 00:53:41.343
Yes!

00:53:44.429 --> 00:53:45.764
I'm a genius.

00:53:58.818 --> 00:54:00.236
PARK MIN-JAE

00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:04.824
Never there when you need him.

00:54:26.304 --> 00:54:27.514
Outside parking lot.

00:54:27.597 --> 00:54:29.140
Kim Seo-jun spotted. Come here.

00:54:33.603 --> 00:54:34.771
Kim Seo-jun!

00:54:35.689 --> 00:54:36.898
Stop right there!

00:54:38.692 --> 00:54:39.985
Stop!

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:47.283
JO-I IS ON THE WAY TO MY STUDIO
COME AND CATCH HER

00:54:48.535 --> 00:54:49.536
Hey!

00:54:53.331 --> 00:54:55.417
You got me. I surrender.

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:00.797
What?

00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:02.257
What's this?

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:06.511
I DID JUST AS JEONG I-SHIN DID.
YOU NEED TO TREAT ME THE SAME.

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:23.570
Damn it. What's going on?

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.448
We'll be taking this.

00:55:26.531 --> 00:55:28.241
Let's happily learn our lesson now.

00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:29.617
Mr. Kim Seo-jun.

00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:33.496
You're under arrest
for illegal narcotics use and possession.

00:55:35.957 --> 00:55:38.418
JO-I IS ON THE WAY TO MY STUDIO
COME AND CATCH HER

00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:57.687
SEONGSIN PNP PRINTING

00:56:12.452 --> 00:56:13.453
Back then…

00:56:16.706 --> 00:56:18.458
why didn't you tell me?

00:56:21.544 --> 00:56:22.545
About your husband.

00:56:23.254 --> 00:56:24.422
The well.

00:56:25.965 --> 00:56:27.050
Your first murder.

00:56:29.135 --> 00:56:30.720
You didn't ask.

00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:35.225
Aside from the five that were discovered,

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:37.727
you never asked about anything else

00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:41.356
as if doing so would infringe
on my privacy.

00:56:51.699 --> 00:56:52.742
I heard you visited

00:56:54.285 --> 00:56:55.620
Park Eon-bae,

00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:59.082
Park Min-jae's father,
to kill him back then.

00:57:14.681 --> 00:57:15.849
I just don't know

00:57:19.978 --> 00:57:22.397
what I've been doing up until now.

00:57:25.775 --> 00:57:26.818
Tell me.

00:57:28.611 --> 00:57:32.365
What else is there?
Exactly how many more are out there?

00:57:34.701 --> 00:57:35.702
I know it's late…

00:57:37.787 --> 00:57:39.038
but let me still ask now.

00:57:40.373 --> 00:57:41.374
Chief Choi,

00:57:41.916 --> 00:57:44.836
you have always trusted people so easily,
back then and even now.

00:57:46.379 --> 00:57:48.214
That's your issue.

00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:52.594
You wanted to help me back then as well.

00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:54.804
I remember.

00:57:56.097 --> 00:57:57.390
Park Eon-bae.

00:57:59.601 --> 00:58:02.395
Were you really planning to kill him?

00:58:06.274 --> 00:58:09.861
That kid was always
lingering around our place.

00:58:10.695 --> 00:58:12.030
Min-jae.

00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:13.698
Park Min-jae.

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.911
When he looked like he was starving,
I would feed him.

00:58:18.745 --> 00:58:21.164
When his face was covered in soot,
I would bathe him.

00:58:21.247 --> 00:58:22.290
I even played with him.

00:58:23.833 --> 00:58:27.295
But he was always desperately
yearning for something.

00:58:46.439 --> 00:58:48.107
Min-jae!

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.028
This is Detective Kim Na-hee
of Nambu Police.

00:58:52.111 --> 00:58:54.155
- Please send an ambulance to 68 Hyeon-ro.
- Min-jae!

00:59:01.621 --> 00:59:02.622
Min-jae.

00:59:03.456 --> 00:59:05.542
Min-jae, you need to wake up.

00:59:05.625 --> 00:59:06.834
Who did this to you?

00:59:06.918 --> 00:59:08.670
Who did this to you?

00:59:08.753 --> 00:59:09.754
Min-jae.

00:59:18.471 --> 00:59:19.472
Min-jae.

00:59:20.682 --> 00:59:21.641
Bro.

00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:23.851
Min-jae, you need to wake up.

00:59:24.602 --> 00:59:26.229
It'll arrive in five minutes.

00:59:31.484 --> 00:59:32.902
Min-jae, you can't die.

00:59:32.986 --> 00:59:34.654
Wake up!

00:59:34.737 --> 00:59:37.198
You need to wake up, Min-jae!

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:12.317
{\an8}Please help me.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.320
{\an8}I will think like Jeong I-shin
and act like Jeong I-shin.

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:16.237
{\an8}Hey.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:17.614
{\an8}Kang Yeong-ho
from the coal miners' housing.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:19.407
{\an8}His nose was seared with a hot spoon,

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:21.159
{\an8}before bleeding to death.

01:00:21.242 --> 01:00:22.243
{\an8}You know this song, don't you?

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:25.830
{\an8}He even hummed
the same song from 23 years ago.

01:00:25.913 --> 01:00:27.665
{\an8}The victim is already in danger.

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:29.500
{\an8}He will end up dead at this rate!

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:32.754
{\an8}Some bloodshed will be inevitable
if we want to catch the culprit.

01:00:32.837 --> 01:00:34.922
{\an8}We have no need for a captain
who has no interest

01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:36.507
{\an8}in keeping victims alive.

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:37.467
{\an8}Please leave.

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:41.554
