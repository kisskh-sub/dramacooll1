WEBVTT

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.480
We’re recording.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.840
Zoom in.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.260
What are Atom and Samut arguing about?

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.280
What’s that all about?

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.980
- Oh!
- Look!

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.370
Atom!

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.780
What’s going on?

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.890
Go take a look!

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.090
Atom!

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.890
Go and check him out.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.940
Wait.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.500
What’s happened?

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.490
Atom!

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.390
Atom!

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.120
Atom!

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.130
What the hell’s going on?

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.740
Go get a teacher here!

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.070
Call an ambulance!

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.080
Hurry!

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.390
He’s gone too far!

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.750
Atom!

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.590
He’s bleeding.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.200
Aren’t you friends?

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.760
Samut.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.460
Samut, we’re here.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:54.950
Dad.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.500
Maybe I don’t have to go to school.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.840
Of course, you do.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.000
Education comes first.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.600
Just think of your future.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.500
You don’t have to worry about money.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.500
I can figure something out.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.070
LOAN AGREEMENT

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.550
All you have to do is focus on your study.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.200
Forget about what happened.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.330
You’re starting over with a clean slate.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.790
Alright?

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.300
Look at this kid dancing.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.810
You can tell he doesn’t know
what he’s doing!

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.830
You’re so right.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.620
You guys, don’t bully him.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.340
Yes, Madam President.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.800
Can you hold off your lecture for,
like, five minutes?

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.580
You’re spoiling all the fun!

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.610
That’s so true.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.890
- Alright, alright.
- It’s just for laughs and giggles.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.080
What is he even doing!

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.300
Oh, she’s here.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.390
Class, pay attention.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.110
Good morning, Miss.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.500
Good morning, everyone.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.500
We have a transfer student today.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.180
- You make sure to be nice…
- No one moves school mid-term.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500
…unless they’re bad news.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.340
Don’t you think?
- Definitely.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.570
Oh, but he’s hot!

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.570
Why don’t you introduce yourself?

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.770
My name is Samut.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.440
Nice to meet you.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.770
Wait… I’ve seen him before.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.780
Isn’t he the guy in that video
who bashes his friend?

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.920
- Oh, he is.
- Look it up.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.940
Here.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.140
- Let me see.
- That’s so scary.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.460
That’s him.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.000
- How could he do such a thing?
- I think it’s definitely him.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.400
Everyone, be quiet.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.200
Keep your phones away.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.800
Don’t you know what time it is?

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.500
You can take the empty seat over there.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.160
Go on.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.230
Yes.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.670
Mamay.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.000
I trust you’ll take care of
our new friend.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.170
Yes.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.700
Now get ready for our lesson.
Open your textbook.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.300
Turn to page 50.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.130
Mamay, did you bring your textbook?

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.240
Of course.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.160
I swear I keep forgetting
this class exists.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.410
Atom, you jerk!

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.660
Shit!

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.570
I heard the student who got punched
had to be in the ICU.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.700
I’ll bet you anything he got expelled
and had to move to our school.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.290
Look at this.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.400
The comments are brutal, too.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:50.970
Look.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.600
I kinda crave some ice cream today.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.700
- Let’s go, then. It’s been a while.
- Let’s do that.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.020
Mamay, you wanna come out
for some ice cream with us?

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.700
I’m on student committee duty.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.990
I don’t think I can make it.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.176
You guys should go on ahead.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.900
You work way too hard, you know that?

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.940
We’re off, then.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.860
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.570
- Think of me when you have it!
- We will.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.980
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.820
Mamay.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.930
Go down to the Headmaster’s office later.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
He wants to talk to you.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.540
Yes.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.800
Samut.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.120
You, too.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.710
Yes.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.700
What do you mean, Headmaster?

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.700
I need you to see...

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.200
if there’s any academic club
that still needs new members

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.760
so Samut can join.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.400
But we usually take
the student’s GPA into account, sir.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.200
I guess you didn’t know, then, Napassorn?

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.100
Samut has won countless
academic awards at his previous school.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.300
But each school has their own criteria.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.380
Wouldn’t this be disadvantageous
to our students?

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.290
Isn’t Mr. Samut ‘our’ student?

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.420
Alright.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.940
Give him a tour of our school’s clubs.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.380
I’ll leave him with you.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.440
Of course.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.050
So… what are you good at?

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.780
I need to know so I can give you
some recommendations.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.600
You can choose for me.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.800
I don’t mind anything.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.500
Our school is renowned
for our academics and sports.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.050
Our students win awards every year.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.376
CONGRATULATIONS TO
MR. NATDANAI PREEDASIRIKUL

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.760
You might be considered outstanding
at your previous school,

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.900
but here, if you’re not good enough,

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.110
I don’t think there’s a place for you.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.400
There’s no place for you here.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.450
I don’t mind not joining any clubs.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.300
You can just tell the Headmaster
I’m not qualified.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.250
You don’t think
I’m one of you anyway, do you?

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.900
I’m sorry for what I said.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.290
I… don’t think you’re a bad person.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.220
Did you know

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.100
you’re looking at me like I’m a bully,
the way everyone is?

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:40.800
Well, is it true?

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.090
Are you who everyone says you are?

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.950
This is exactly why no one
wants to be your friend!

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.160
- He’s bleeding!
- Did you have to do that to him?

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.310
I…

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.560
What is that building?

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.100
It used to be a gymnasium,

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.100
but now it’s just for storage.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.500
It’s been out of use for ages.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.290
There was this rumor that some student
disappeared there 30 years ago.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.350
No one goes there anymore.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.450
I think someone did.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:41.940
Kaen.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.650
What do you think you’re doing!

00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.200
We’re not doing anything.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.270
Help!

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.430
Help me!

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.170
Please!

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.060
Kaen!

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.250
Mamay.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.140
Careful.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.150
Why are you doing this?

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.100
We’re not doing anything.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.090
He was already locked inside
that locker when we got here.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.040
Am I right, Kaen?

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.190
Hmm?

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.300
Kaen, don’t be afraid.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.830
You can tell me. I’ll help you.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.810
It was someone else.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.850
These two didn’t do anything.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.600
See? That’s exactly what I said!

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.500
But you might wanna keep your nose
out of people’s business, Prez.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.510
Hey, Don.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.690
That’s the new student
everyone’s talking about.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:01.680
Hey.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.200
Didn’t you get expelled ’cause
you punched someone?

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.100
I don’t care how tough you were
back in your old school,

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.610
but I’m dying to find out.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.800
All you have to do is focus on your study.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.930
Forget about what happened.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.180
You’re starting over with a clean slate.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.600
I don’t fight.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:43.570
I’ll back away.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:45.950
Oww.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.280
We thought you’d be tough,
but as it turned out, you’re just a wimp.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:54.220
What was the beef with your pal
that he deserved such a pounding?

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.400
Was it over some candies?

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.200
I’m a wimp.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.170
But at least I’m not stupid enough
to bully someone

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.270
and leave evidence behind.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.650
Didn’t you know the blood and
your footprints would be easy proof?

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.010
And those who choose to bully a student
who’s made a name for their school,

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.550
thinking they’d get away with it…

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.670
are the stupidest.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.190
Screw you!

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.310
You jerk!

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.729
Stop it right now
or I’m calling the teacher!

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.390
Stay out of people’s business,
you snitch!

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.100
Don’t think anyone will come
and save you.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.420
What the hell is going on?

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:33.850
Shit.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.120
What the hell happened?

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:36.570
Don.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:37.540
Don?

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.710
Don, is that you?

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.800
It’s me.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.140
I’m here.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.270
- Kaen?
- Don?

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.800
- Kaen, are you alright?
- I’m here.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.900
Don.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.330
Mamay.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.490
Look.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.300
This isn’t the old gymnasium.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.100
What the hell happened?

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.600
Huh?

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:31.730
What the hell did you do?

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.500
We didn’t do anything.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.940
You’re Mark from Class 4.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.250
And that’s…

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.170
Her name’s Pie.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.100
What are you doing here?

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.500
I was in the closet with Pie.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.500
Suddenly there was an earthquake.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.790
I was just looking for an exit,
but this is where the door led us to.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:29.510
So everyone was in the old gym
before we got here?

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.000
What is this place?

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.400
Welcome, all eight players,
to Djehuty, the game of wits,

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.110
where all your desires will come true.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.320
Game?

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:15.170
What the hell are you talking about!

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.400
My phone isn’t working.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.060
What the hell?

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.490
What?

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.600
That’s impossible.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.180
Damn, Don.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.140
The doors really are all connected!

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:26.950
Damn…

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:28.740
Isn’t that amazing?

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.600
Amazing, my ass.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.200
How are we going to get out of here?

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:48.970
There’s one more person.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.300
The voice welcomed eight players.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:58.910
Right now,

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.160
there are only seven of us.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:04.980
He’s right.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.180
Guys.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.900
This room isn’t like the rest.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.090
Someone’s on the floor.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.100
She’s one of us.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.100
Do any of you know her?

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.470
Hey.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.840
Hey.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:08.810
Hey.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.860
Easy! Easy!

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.040
Easy!

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:15.800
My name is Mamay.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.400
I’m the student president.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.620
What’s your name?

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.590
Aom.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.250
My name is Aom.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.590
Uhh…

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.270
Do you remember how you got here, Aom?

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:45.600
I don’t remember anything.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.600
Next thing I know I was here.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.490
All eight players, get ready for the game.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.900
Players, choose a room.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:34.610
Ugh!

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.660
I ain’t playing your stupid game!

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.030
I’m going home!

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:39.490
You hear me?

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:40.950
I’m going home!

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:42.790
Hello?

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.790
What game is he talking about, Mark?

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:46.940
I don’t know, either.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.810
Should we just play along with the voice?

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.300
Will we be able to leave
if we do play the game?

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.840
Are you insane?

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.540
Who the hell would be up for a game
in this situation?

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.700
Use your damn brains.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.500
Hey, what are you doing?

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.000
I can’t get in!

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:52.830
There are eight doors.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.300
You can’t get in this room
because I’ve taken it.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.200
You must choose your own.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:10.860
Hey.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.110
What are you doing?

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:15.980
Aom got in.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.000
Mamay. We have to choose.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.690
Umm.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:33.710
Mark.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.210
Pie.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:37.570
You get in that room behind you.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.820
I’ll choose another one.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.840
Player, place your hand on top of the box.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.530
You are assigned as a Detective.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.190
Detective?

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.900
The Murder of a Student.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:09.300
In 1995, a gruesome crime occurred.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.180
A student was murdered,

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.290
and her body was hidden
inside this school.

00:24:13.291 --> 00:24:15.371
3 SEP 1995
and her body was hidden
inside this school.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.890
Players will be assigned as Detectives

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.500
and must find the hidden body
within this school.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.780
The body is hidden inside a classroom
in the secondary school building.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.690
Players are allowed to ask for clues

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.400
by communicating
with the ghost of the victim,

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.300
through the medium coins,
in which each player will receive three.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:52.290
There are two options
when communicating with the spirit:

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.600
One, to answer whether the body
is hidden in a certain room.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:02.100
Two, to ask the direction of the room
in which the body is hidden.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.440
Detectives have one hour
to search for the body.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:15.500
The game will conclude when a Detective
has correctly located the body.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:18.990
The Detective with the wrong answer

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:25.180
will be punished
by confinement by the ghost of the victim.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.200
Choose your answer wisely,

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:31.190
or you will never leave the place.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:21.710
Mark!

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.460
Mamay.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.400
Are we… back to school?

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.000
Is there such a thing at our school?

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:35.600
I’m not playing this stupid game.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.090
Don!

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.350
What?

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:52.690
We can’t leave?

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:54.900
1995.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.750
Everyone, check this out.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.890
MISSING STUDENT

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:13.720
We’re not back to school.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.920
This is more likely
the location of the game.

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:20.350
Do you remember what the game said?

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:22.500
The Murder of a Student.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:27.000
Are we… in the year 1995?

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:37.800
Maybe… this has something to do with
that rumor of a missing student?

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.050
MUTHITA

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.720
It means we have to complete
this game, doesn’t it?

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.700
Where is the body?

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:49.650
I remember.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.300
It said the body is hidden in one of
the classes in the secondary building.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.170
Let’s work together to find the body

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.200
and quickly get out of here.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:00.100
And if we can’t find the body?

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.540
Didn’t it say we’d be stuck here forever?

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.360
Let’s just play the game.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.700
We won’t get out of here
if we don’t do anything.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.800
So we really must play?

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.460
According to the rules of the game,

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.490
we must find the body in this building.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.500
Time is already ticking.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.300
What should we do?

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:14.820
The coins.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:16.950
Did you all receive some coins?

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.400
I think we have to use these coins
to win this game together.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:24.950
Together?

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.040
What do you mean?

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.900
Let’s use our coins
in each classroom to find the body.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.520
What do you think?

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.000
It said you will be confined here
if you get the answer wrong.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.100
Who would risk that?

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:38.940
Would you?

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:57.600
I think we should start
by eliminating the wrong choices.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.190
The secondary school building
has four classrooms on each floor.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.096
Four people should enter
the four rooms on the first floor

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.600
and use one coin to ask whether
the body is hidden in the rooms above it.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.820
The other four should go to
the higher floors

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.340
and enter the first classroom
on each floor.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.000
Use one coin to ask whether the body is
hidden in any of the next rooms.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:30.370
If we do this,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.930
it should take no more than two coins each
before we find the body.

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:38.670
Let’s do that, then.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.560
Let’s go.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:52.450
GRADE 7 CLASS 1

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.240
The secondary school classrooms
are on this floor and beyond.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:01.804
We need four people
for these four classrooms.

00:32:04.087 --> 00:32:05.603
Who should enter which room, then?

00:32:07.652 --> 00:32:09.104
I’ll take one room upstairs.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:12.474
You girls should take the ones
on this floor.

00:32:12.498 --> 00:32:14.738
You don’t have to exhaust yourselves
climbing the stairs.

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:16.655
I’m going with you, Mark.

00:32:18.275 --> 00:32:19.309
Me, too.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.204
Mamay and Aom should stay on this floor.

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:26.333
I don’t wanna waste my time walking.

00:32:26.347 --> 00:32:28.027
I’m taking one room on this floor as well.

00:32:30.095 --> 00:32:31.407
I’ll take one room upstairs.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.580
So the ones who take
the classrooms upstairs

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.360
must enter the room on the far left,

00:32:36.473 --> 00:32:38.104
and ask about the rooms on the right.

00:32:38.532 --> 00:32:39.668
Do I understand that correctly?

00:32:39.692 --> 00:32:40.692
Yes.

00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:44.998
Let’s meet back here
once we get our clues.

00:32:45.989 --> 00:32:46.989
Let’s go.

00:33:16.269 --> 00:33:17.269
Pie.

00:33:17.378 --> 00:33:18.378
Don’t be scared.

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:20.300
I’ll see you right after.

00:33:21.883 --> 00:33:23.403
You take the Grade 8-1 classroom.

00:33:44.923 --> 00:33:45.923
I’ll take this one.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.450
GRADE 9 CLASS 1

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.170
GRADE 10 CLASS 1

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:09.210
You take this one.

00:34:09.352 --> 00:34:10.352
I’ll go upstairs.

00:34:10.992 --> 00:34:11.992
Okay.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.210
GRADE 11 CLASS 1

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:25.890
Help…

00:35:27.618 --> 00:35:28.618
Help me.

00:35:32.183 --> 00:35:33.183
Help.

00:35:34.901 --> 00:35:35.901
Help me.

00:35:40.933 --> 00:35:41.933
Help.

00:35:43.676 --> 00:35:44.676
Help me.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:35.130
GRADE 11 CLASS 1

00:36:41.606 --> 00:36:42.606
Pie, calm down.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.860
Will you please tell me what happened?

00:36:45.209 --> 00:36:46.209
Yeah.

00:36:46.278 --> 00:36:47.307
What did you see, Pie?

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.880
I…

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:54.703
I entered the room

00:36:56.075 --> 00:36:58.403
and saw that there was a phone
in the middle of the room.

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:00.630
When I put the coin in,

00:37:00.698 --> 00:37:03.900
someone was calling for help
at the other end.

00:37:07.523 --> 00:37:09.600
I got so scared that I ran away.

00:37:10.852 --> 00:37:13.450
So you didn’t even ask for any clues.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:18.503
You shouldn’t be playing this kind of game
if you’re so easily frightened.

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.175
Don’t scold her.

00:37:21.667 --> 00:37:23.000
I’m sure she didn’t mean to.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:29.050
Everyone’s playing this for the first time
so it makes sense to be confused.

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:32.706
But you seem to handle this pretty well.

00:37:38.378 --> 00:37:39.806
What about the rest of you?

00:37:40.323 --> 00:37:42.203
I entered the Grade 7-2 classroom

00:37:42.338 --> 00:37:44.100
and the light flickered,

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.152
and then it just turned red.

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:49.310
I think that means the body
isn’t in any classrooms above it.

00:37:51.993 --> 00:37:54.007
I saw a flickering light
that turned red, too.

00:37:55.446 --> 00:37:57.010
The light in my classroom turned green.

00:38:03.973 --> 00:38:07.207
I remember that after I pushed
the button on the phone…

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.652
The light suddenly turned green.

00:38:25.638 --> 00:38:26.983
And I saw…

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.006
someone’s silhouette above me.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:38.303
It means the body is in one of the rooms
above the Grade 7-3 classroom.

00:38:39.501 --> 00:38:40.701
I think so.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:43.690
Did the light turn green
in anyone else’s classroom?

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:46.358
Mine turned red.

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:49.090
Mine as well.

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:50.290
Same here.

00:38:51.315 --> 00:38:52.875
The light in my classroom turned green.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.333
I entered, saw the light flicker,
and then…

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:00.350
saw the shape of someone lying
on the floor to the right of the room.

00:39:00.455 --> 00:39:01.455
Yep.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.003
I think we found where the body is hidden!

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.601
We got a clue from Mamay in...

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.703
the classroom of Grade 7-3,

00:39:18.943 --> 00:39:21.806
and from Benz in the classroom
of Grade 9-1.

00:39:22.876 --> 00:39:25.244
That means the body is hidden
in the classroom of…

00:39:27.815 --> 00:39:28.815
Grade 9 Class 3!

00:39:30.524 --> 00:39:31.524
Let’s go.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.250
GRADE 9 CLASS 3

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.220
It is this room, isn’t it?

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.506
I will enter and answer

00:39:59.121 --> 00:40:00.303
so we can all go home.

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.100
Help.

00:40:43.812 --> 00:40:44.812
Help me.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.080
Help.

00:40:51.489 --> 00:40:52.489
Help m...

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:21.886
The Detective has given
an incorrect answer.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:25.307
The Detective will be
punished by confinement.

00:41:31.898 --> 00:41:32.898
Mamay?

00:41:33.276 --> 00:41:33.881
Mamay!

00:41:33.966 --> 00:41:35.001
How could it be wrong?

00:41:36.286 --> 00:41:37.286
Mamay!

00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:39.596
Mamay!

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.100
Can you hear me?

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:43.960
Mamay!

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:45.330
It won’t open.

00:41:45.752 --> 00:41:46.752
Mamay!

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.720
You said the body is hidden
in this classroom!

00:41:49.524 --> 00:41:50.524
How did we get it wrong?

00:41:52.552 --> 00:41:53.603
I don’t know.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.003
The clues led us here.

00:41:56.373 --> 00:41:57.707
It wasn’t supposed to be wrong.

00:42:00.743 --> 00:42:02.423
Maybe this stupid game is messing with us.

00:42:12.666 --> 00:42:14.016
I don’t wanna waste my time walking.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.400
I’m taking one room on this floor.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.524
Mamay and Aom should stay on this floor.

00:42:18.796 --> 00:42:20.204
I’ll take one room upstairs.

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:22.106
I’m going with you, Mark.

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:24.270
I’ll take this one.

00:42:27.387 --> 00:42:29.307
What if it’s not the game
that’s messing with us,

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:31.050
but one of us is?

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.100
What do you mean?

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:41.300
I think one of us is lying.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.420
What if it’s not the game
that’s messing with us,

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.606
but one of us is?

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:10.658
You have been assigned as an Accomplice.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.210
One person among the six of you
must be a mole.

00:43:12.223 --> 00:43:13.223
Seven of us,

00:43:13.369 --> 00:43:13.983
with you included.

00:43:14.084 --> 00:43:15.190
Are you accusing me, you jerk!

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:16.298
Why are you fighting?

00:43:21.976 --> 00:43:23.170
It was Mamay who was lying!

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.920
We’re running out of time.

00:43:25.003 --> 00:43:26.003
Let’s split up.

00:43:28.909 --> 00:43:30.206
She’s the mole.
