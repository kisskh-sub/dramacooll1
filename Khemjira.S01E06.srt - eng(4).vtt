Stop it, Ramphueng.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.360
You know my name?

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.800
I was minding my own path.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.820
It is you who came to provoke me.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.920
Go into the forest

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.080
and look for red pieces of paper
rolled like this.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.480
Because it's not dark yet,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.720
Phrai, the territory holder,
is still awake.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.920
Phrai?

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.920
Who's that?

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.480
May I stay here
until the semester break ends?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Please.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.300
Please, Master.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.680
Master's dad and Prim's were close,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.880
so they'd often visit each other.

[Ubon Ratchathani, 2010]

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.670
Honey...

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.560
Honey!

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.800
Honey...

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.200
Why are you not in bed?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.759
You should lie down and rest.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.320
Why are you here?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.770
Wanted some music.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.620
The cassette tape's stretched.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.520
I was gonna fix it.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.440
Why didn't you tell me?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.720
You were out to pick up our son.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.840
I thought I could do it myself.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.960
I've been so drained lately.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.400
I can't even listen to music
without bothering someone.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.560
You're like this

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.520
because of my dad.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.000
It's all on him.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.280
All done, Mom.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.440
I'll heat up the food.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.560
Okay.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.800
What's wrong?

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.680
Easy, sweetie.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.400
You're not a little boy anymore.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.640
I spoke with your dad.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.320
If you want to keep learning
shamanic practices with Grandpa,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.600
he won't stop you.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.080
When you grow up,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.000
I know you're gonna be
a really great shaman.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.680
I really wish you could be here
until I become a shaman.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.880
You know what?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.000
Being a shaman means
you can't have a lover, sweetie.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.240
I don't need one, Mom.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.080
You're such a sweet talker,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.200
Peem.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.320
I'll be watching over you.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.480
Paran and Prim are already close.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.240
He's not a kid anymore.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.320
He needs to have his own life.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.280
He needs to have his own life?

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.920
I'd say it's the life you chose for him.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.080
He's your son, yet you don't even know

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.640
that he wants to be a shaman here.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.900
That's on you.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.320
You've been drilling that into him.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.159
And you?

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.440
You're making him marry
Mr. Chang's daughter to pay off a debt.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.760
But did you even ask him?

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.440
Mr. Chang tricked you
into that investment,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.040
and it all went to hell.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.120
You were so messed up
that I had to help.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.400
Do you want me to be honest

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.240
and tell you who's actually to blame?

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.360
My wife is dead,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.960
and Paran's lost his mom.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.640
Our family ended up like this

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.320
all because of you, Dad,
isn't that right?

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200
Don't you think so?

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.000
I didn't mean for any of it.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.800
And that made it even worse.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.740
You knew damn well

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.000
it would all backfire on your family,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.560
but you just kept going.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.320
Learned a new technique
from Uncle Kasem,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.200
so you wanted to try it out, huh?

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.520
Chai...

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.400
has helped us a lot.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.960
When trouble came,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.480
I wanted to help him, too.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.920
You are right.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.760
But if that curse really backfires,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
I can still break it.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.600
But you couldn't

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.120
'cause you're not that good, Dad.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.600
And all this acting nice
to your grandson...

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.280
is to cover up your mistake, right?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.520
Paran?

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.000
Is that true, Grandpa?

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.200
So it turns out
no one truly cares about me.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.240
Paran!

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.200
Paran...

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.240
Your dad has sent his regards.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.440
He also said

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.040
he missed you and our home.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.680
No need to lie, Grandpa.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.840
He fled overseas to avoid his debts

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.560
because he didn't care about me.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.560
I don't think he's coming back.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.240
As for the debt he owes Mr. Chang,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.840
I'm taking care of it.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.680
After this, it's up to you

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.560
which way you want to go.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.960
Okay.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.240
I chose to ordain

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.560
because I genuinely wanted to know

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.720
what my life is meant for.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.140
I'm sorry

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.620
for everything
that happened to your mom.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.300
I know

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.740
that you're still upset

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.880
and angry with me,

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.540
but I don't have the nerve
to ask for your forgiveness.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.960
I just want you to remember that...

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.820
if you ever want to become a shaman,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.760
I'll still be waiting for you at home.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.780
I just...

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.180
wanted to try it out.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.740
Haven't I told you

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.660
that we're no longer in love
with each other?

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.060
Just give up.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.940
You promised me

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.540
that you wouldn't cause me any trouble.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.340
If you wanna stay, just stay.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.180
But don't force me to do anything.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.940
It's impossible between us.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.300
Is it?

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.260
All this time that you've been helping

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.210
and protecting me...

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.740
You were not willing to do it, were you?

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.860
Did I force you to do that?

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.900
You don't need to answer me.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.500
This is clear enough.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.620
I'm sorry for everything, then.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.780
And...

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.660
about tonight...

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.260
Please act as if it never happened.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:25.500
Whoa.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.380
You could totally
be a master chef, Khem.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.460
Once you graduate,
you should open a restaurant.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.660
You'd better be ready
to gain some weight

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.580
'cause after this,
Khem's going to cook every meal for us!

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.060
That's good news!

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.940
Thank you, Khem.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:51.860
Khem...

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.260
Khem!

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.540
Yeah?

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:58.780
Oh...

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.460
Looks like he's still sad.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.260
I can see it.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.300
My eyesight
is so much better than yours.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.900
Hey, Khem.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.579
Wanna go paddle at the lotus pond today?

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:26.619
It's gorgeous there!

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.020
Wow...

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.140
That sounds like a brilliant idea.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.980
Makes me want to go right away.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.580
The lotus pond!

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.020
The lotus pond...

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.740
You wanted to become my disciple,

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.580
but didn't want to learn anything?

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:50.980
Finish your meal and come with me.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.020
I'll teach you
the basics of white magic.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.780
Okay, Master.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.300
Master...

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.060
What about breakfast?

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.980
I'm good.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:15.940
Uh...

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.060
It's already ready.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.580
I can take it upstairs for you.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.460
No need.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.740
I'm not hungry.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.300
Come on,

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.100
I made your favorite dishes here.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.380
I was being clear enough.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.780
Eat it yourself
if you don't wanna throw it.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.420
Or just give it to Dotty.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.020
Go.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.740
I was pretending nothing happened.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.940
Khem!

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.660
Khem!

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.220
Oh, Grandma Si?

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.490
- Hello.
- Good morning.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.100
Hi.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.740
Are you here for Master?

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:44.900
For you.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.220
I'm going into town
for a vital force calling,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.460
so I'm here to get you.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.980
Me?

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.100
Yeah.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.620
I might have to ask Master
for his permission.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.900
You don't.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.740
He told me to get you.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:07.660
Let's go.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:10.940
Okay.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.860
Right, hold on.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.580
Thongphun,

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:16.860
give me the herb.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.100
Here, take this.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.820
What is it?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.220
It's a turmeric called Pra-taba.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.660
It's incredibly powerful.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.640
Spirits, whether good or bad,

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.760
won't come near.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.660
Your master has plenty upstairs.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.340
I also have some in the car.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.180
You should take it

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.540
to strengthen your protection.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.100
Okay.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.500
Thank you, Grandma.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.140
Are you going into town?

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.660
This is it. We're here.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.780
Stop the car.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.980
Okay.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.820
Khem, take the stuff
and come with me, okay?

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.020
Grandma...

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.520
Come on.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.620
Hurry.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.580
- What?
- Come here.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:51.740
She's upstairs.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.180
Jeez.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.980
What's going on now?

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.540
Please help me.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.780
That's why I'm here.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.260
Big...

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.540
Where is she?

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.580
Big...

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:10.980
Big...

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:13.710
She's not actually sick.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:14.900
Big...

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.180
Big!

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:17.620
How is she feeling?

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:19.700
Big!

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.140
Big...

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:23.500
Hey.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.020
Big...

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.180
Is there any way to help her?

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.540
She's been like this for two days.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.340
Seems like she got even worse today.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.620
She hasn't breastfed her baby
all day, either.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.380
I'm the one taking care of it.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.420
It's nothing new.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.940
Her vital force has left her body

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.420
and is around her boyfriend.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.860
Big hasn't visited her
at all for months,

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.380
and he won't even pick up her calls.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.300
Big...

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.740
She might be mad at him

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.340
for leaving her.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.860
His family wouldn't let him come,
would they?

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.860
They can't just let her
raise the baby by herself.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.820
Isn't that too cruel?

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:01.860
Big...

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.140
There are 40 subjects of meditation.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.620
You need to practice them
one set at a time.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.220
Read through these.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.300
I'll teach you the one you want.
[Supreme Buddhist Mantras of Great Power]

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.300
[Patipada: Path of Practice]

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.540
But it takes time to master each one.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.140
How quickly someone masters

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.580
it depends on each person.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:50.940
Okay, Master.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:53.980
The other book

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.020
is a book of mantras.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.740
It's filled with
protective incantations.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.380
However, you must not
use them improperly.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.940
Let's start with meditation, then.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.260
[Phra Nakhon, 1941]

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.580
I'm sorry.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.300
I woke you up.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.580
It's okay.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.220
I shouldn't be sleeping here
in the first place.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.540
Give me some more time.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.860
You're so gorgeous
without your glasses.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:15.860
Jin!

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.180
We're not at home now.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.180
It's a holiday.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.620
How many people would actually
be hanging out in the library like you?

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.420
Are you getting tired of this?

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:30.860
Not at all!

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.380
Da,

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.660
do you think...

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.640
we should tell Khem about us?

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.940
Well...

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.380
Khem's still sad about Wat.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.420
If we tell her,

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.060
will it make her feel even lonelier?

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.100
Really?

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.300
Is that the actual reason?

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.900
Not because you're afraid
she won't support us, right?

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:19.900
No.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.140
I'm just worried that
she'll feel like she's a third wheel.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.100
Though we've never seen her
act that way,

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.100
someone like her
would definitely overthink it.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.420
How about we wait
until Wat comes back

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.340
and tell her at her wedding?

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.700
We could even take that chance

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.260
to go on a honeymoon with them.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.660
Sounds good?

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:53.780
Yeah.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.660
That's a promise.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.900
That's a promise.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.540
That's a promise.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.420
That's a promise.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.540
Jet...

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.340
Jet!

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:48.980
Jet!

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.100
Master Paran asked me
to take care of this boy,

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.300
so he's here.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.370
I see.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:17.860
Come on, hurry.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.940
Suay is coming home soon.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.460
- Alright.
- Come in.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.620
Come on, Khem.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.780
You're not just a boy anymore,
you know that?

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.740
Found someone new
and forgot the old one, huh?

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.420
How about ending things with Earn first

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.900
- Come on...
- before being with this one?

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.300
It's not that I've stopped loving her,

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.220
and I couldn't just leave my baby there.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.500
So you want both of them?

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.100
What's stopping you
from going back to her, seriously?

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:46.900
I can't go.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.030
Stop asking me.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.100
Don't tell me what to do.
I know what to do.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.660
- Do it.
- Go away from me.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.420
Jeez.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.460
It's ready, Grandma.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.580
Sadhu.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.260
Dear all deities,

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.740
household deity, Goddess of the Earth,

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.980
and the guardians of this land,

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.860
I'm here to call upon Earn's vital force

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.180
to return to her body.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.580
Is that Suay?

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.420
- Let this ritual succeed and be blessed.
- Yeah.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.380
She's my wife.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.590
May her vital force come to me.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.340
She was actually my other girlfriend,

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.660
but she's legally my wife now.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:29.820
My family wanted me to marry her.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.540
But...

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.300
you and Earn
have a baby together, though.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.780
You won't understand.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.580
You'll face these problems
once you grow up.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.380
Mom...

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.060
Grandma Si?

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.860
Right, it's me.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.540
Do you want to eat something?

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.700
I'll make you something tasty.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.660
Okay.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.260
I'll tie your wrist.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.700
May you be alright,

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.540
and may your vital force be with you.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.420
May it bring healing to you.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.500
Eat a lot. Take enough rest.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.780
Always think of your baby
and mom, okay?

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.780
If your vital force
leaves your body again,

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.820
I'll let Master give you
a serious lesson.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.260
Auntie, are you home?

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.220
What?

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.940
Your car is blocking the road.
Come move it.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:58.980
Got it.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.020
Wait,

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.700
maybe that's my car.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.980
Where's my driver, though?

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.340
Thongphun...

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.180
What a smart-ass.
He must be somewhere else.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.060
I'll give him a call.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.500
Grandma, thank you so much.

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.380
Yeah.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.540
Hope you feel better.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.660
We'll take our leave.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.020
- Okay.
- Jeez.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.940
He sure knows how to slack.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.460
I'll go wash the baby bottle
and prepare a new one.

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:37.620
Hey, Thongphun.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.380
Come here now.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.020
Can't take my eyes off of you, can I?

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.900
You sure know how to slack off, huh?

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.220
Jeez.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:01.780
Khem...

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.460
What's wrong?

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:08.580
What happened?

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:09.940
I think...

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.500
Ramphueng's here with me.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.020
What?

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.100
Earn!

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.100
Earn,

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:23.540
where are you?

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.659
- Earn!
- Ugh, what now?

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.659
Earn's missing!

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:29.300
She took her baby, too.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:31.739
How is that possible?
I just got down here.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:32.739
Go look for her.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.780
I've looked everywhere,
but I couldn't find her.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.620
Are you sure you have?

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.020
How could she leave that fast?

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:44.340
Where could she possibly go?

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:46.020
Jet,

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.300
are you with Master?

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:50.110
Can't find her.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.100
I think...

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.060
Ramphueng's messing with us.

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.940
Are you crazy?

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.580
Why did you bring the baby?

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.540
Suay is home.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.780
I told you I'd visit you when I can.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.060
I have only one question.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:31.980
Give me the answer,

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.620
and I'll leave.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.260
Do you still love me?

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:42.700
Earn!

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.420
You came here just for this?

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:47.980
But it matters to me.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.620
Answer me,

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.780
so I'll know what to do next.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:52.860
Earn,

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:56.980
go home.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:58.580
Your mom's worried about you.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.740
Why are you here, Master?

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.740
You told me
you'd stay away from him, didn't you?

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.780
I just want to know

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.780
if he still loves me and our baby.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.780
I'm tired...

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.520
of raising this baby all alone.

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.060
What's going on?

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.420
So you haven't visited us at all...

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.820
Get inside, Suay. It's unsafe.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.180
So now, I'm making her feel unsafe?

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.820
The one to blame

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.800
is the person who left his baby
and didn't own up, isn't it?

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.860
I carried this child

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.140
because you said you loved me.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.660
But how could you treat me like this?

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:14.780
Earn!

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.260
You damn ghost,

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.060
get out of my daughter's body now!

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.060
Let her go.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.140
She has nothing to do with this.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:35.500
You're wrong.

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.700
No spirit did this.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.820
What do you mean?

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.420
Then, why is she like this
all of a sudden?

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.420
What's wrong with me?

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.380
Yeah,

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.500
I guess it's just me.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.420
The only crazy one,

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.860
the only fool!

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.540
Earn,

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.860
let's come home.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.220
Forget that bastard.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.340
No.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.300
I won't leave

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.260
unless I get my answer.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.860
Do you still love me?

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.820
Answer me!

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:46.300
I...

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.620
No matter what,

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:58.900
I always want the best for you.

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.340
So that's a no.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.620
You can't even be honest about it.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.900
You're expecting another baby,

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.080
so I guess...

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.940
I won't have to take care
of this shit anymore.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.820
- Earn!
- Earn!

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.260
- Earn...
- Leave me alone!

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:27.420
Stay away from me.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.980
Get a grip!

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.220
You better know
what you're trying to do.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:56.300
- Earn...
- Earn!

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.220
- Earn!
- Earn!

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:03.740
Ma'am!

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.000
Ma'am...

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.500
No!

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:07.980
Ma'am!

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.140
Let go of me!

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.380
Ma'am...

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.020
Earn...

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:41.780
Earn!

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.020
Earn...

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.460
Why did you do that?

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:50.740
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.380
I didn't know what to do.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:55.380
Master,

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.820
I'm really sorry.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.180
If it were you hurting yourself,

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.260
I'd stay out of it.

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.900
But you literally involved your child,

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.580
and that made you even worse than him.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:15.940
You're no different.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:18.900
Selfish.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:20.780
Self-centered.

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.940
You nearly turned a woman
into a murderer.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.700
I'm sorry.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.900
I'm sorry, Earn.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:35.140
If you're not ready to be parents,

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.540
let the child live.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.020
Your child isn't a doll

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.100
you can just toss around.

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.020
Will you raise your baby?

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.100
If not,

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.500
then place the child in an orphanage.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.660
Take care of Earn.

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.980
Let her heal.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.320
Find her a job.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.020
When she's ready,
she can get her baby back.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.380
Thank you, Master.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.740
Without your power,

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.700
things would've turned out worse.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.180
It wasn't me.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:57.380
Oh...

00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:59.260
If it wasn't you...

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:00.500
Quit nagging me, will you?

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.220
Take care of yourself.

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:27.100
Master,

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.020
take Khem back with you.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.220
He can stay and help you

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.620
until you're all done.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.260
Are you mad at each other?

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.580
Uh...

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:12.780
We're not.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.780
Anyway, Grandma Si,

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.340
when everyone froze just now,

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.820
was it really
not because of Master's power?

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.860
Master was telling the truth.

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.140
But is it true...

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:38.180
that Ramphueng's been following you?

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.180
Well...

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:45.300
Yes.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:50.300
Also, she always messes
with people's minds.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.740
I'm so scared

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:56.420
that if anything goes wrong,
I'll be the cause.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:59.500
Don't overthink it.

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.860
Master already told you

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.280
that Earn did that on her own.

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.380
She loved him so much

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.940
that she lost her mind,

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.100
acting like she was possessed.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:11.940
No need to worry.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:31.420
So it was you who saved the baby.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.340
Though you've lost
most of your humanity,

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.780
you still remember
what it means to be a mother.

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.140
It all turns out that...

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.020
no ghost was possessing her.

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:27.700
It was Earn herself.

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.060
He didn't let her go,

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.300
and she wouldn't move on.

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:36.580
That's why it's toxic.

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.260
I also think...

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.540
I won't bother Master anymore.

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:52.900
What?

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.740
What do you mean?

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:55.940
What's wrong?

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.140
I feel like
I've been making him uncomfortable.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:14.820
That's it.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:16.740
Let's go to sleep.

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.260
Jeez, what is this?

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:40.980
We haven't even set sail,

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.020
but my ship has already sunk.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.620
I respect your decision, Khem.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:50.740
If you want some space to move on,

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:52.780
I'll support you.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.140
Right now,

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.820
your priority should be

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.500
breaking the curse.

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:10.780
But...

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.820
wouldn't it be too hard, Khem?

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.100
I guess there's no choice.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.500
Charn's right.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.140
I should focus on the curse

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:33.380
and not waste time on this stuff.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:20.580
Khem!

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.620
Khem...

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.820
Khem!

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.700
Wake up and talk to me!

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:39.100
I have so many things to tell you.

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.900
Khem...

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:44.540
Calm down, Jin.

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.980
She's no longer with us.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:51.580
Now what, Da?

00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:53.740
Does our promise still matter?

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.780
I'm sorry, Jin.

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:00.060
If we visited her more often,

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:04.220
she wouldn't feel so alone...

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.820
and ended up like this, right, Da?

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.640
We were by her side

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.980
all the way to the end.

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:28.820
I'm sorry, Jin.

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:33.980
It's not your fault.

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.540
Who the heck is Jin?

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:39.060
What am I doing?

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:23.460
- Good morning.
- What's that?

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:27.780
Oh,

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:30.180
I got these
from Uncle Chai this morning.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.220
- I'm gonna make some cushions for...
- That's fine.

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:33.260
No need to trouble yourself.

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:38.860
Well, I was saying...

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:41.260
I'd make some cushions
for Jet and Charn.

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:44.900
They have to meditate for hours,

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:46.500
so they might feel uncomfortable.

00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:48.860
Oh,

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:50.820
is that so?

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:54.660
Good.

00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.500
Are you making coffee?

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:03.360
Then...

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:04.280
No need.

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:11.300
Just do what you need to do.

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:13.540
Oh,

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:15.220
I was gonna say

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.500
you might need to boil some more water

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.140
since I've used it all.

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:30.060
Well,

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.820
if that's all,
I'll put the stuff away now.

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:56.820
Hang in there, Khem.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:11.660
Prim's here again.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:15.800
Wait,

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.140
that's Elder Chang.

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.260
Why is he here?

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:21.500
Who is he?

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:24.500
Prim's dad.

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.780
Isn't it normal for him
to come with his daughter?

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.580
He and Master
have been at odds for ages.

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.260
I don't know why.

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:33.380
Hello, Master.

00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:38.020
Long time no see, Elder.

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.700
You came all the way here.

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.940
Is there a reason for your visit?

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:49.420
Well...

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:51.220
Nothing serious.

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:53.860
My luck's been bad lately,

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:56.580
so Prim suggested I come

00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:59.020
to have you check my fortune.

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.260
I hope you don't mind me being here.

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.780
I absolutely don't.

00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:09.820
Please.

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.340
Hello.

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:29.180
Hello.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.380
Thank you so much.

00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:47.260
I'll go make merit as you suggested.

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.460
Well, actually...

00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:58.380
I came here

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:01.460
to apologize

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:05.500
for what I did
that led to our past conflicts.

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:10.420
I've never had any conflict with you,

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.540
but I'll accept

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.180
the goodwill you have for me.

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.380
Please take this.

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:29.660
Dad wouldn't feel at ease

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:32.260
if he didn't give you something.

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:42.900
Prim's right, Master.

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:23.220
Jet,

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:24.580
put this away.

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.980
Go help Charn with his practice, too.

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:31.460
Okay, Master.

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:55.620
Anyway, please keep looking after
my daughter.

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:07.580
Well,

00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:09.380
actually,

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.700
I need your help, Master.

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:17.980
I'm advising some students right now,

00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:21.420
and they're putting on a play
commemorating the Phi Bun Rebellion.

00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:29.340
The Phi Bun Rebellion?

00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:33.660
You mean the Holy Man's Rebellion?

00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:35.060
Yes.

00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:39.980
It involves spirits
and some real-life events,

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:43.500
so I wanted to ask

00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:47.140
if you could perform the ritual for us.

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:53.520
When?

00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:59.180
May 3rd, Master.

00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:00.950
But there might need to be...

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:03.180
some practice beforehand.

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:35.540
Uh...

00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:37.260
I'm sorry.

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:38.500
Don't be.

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:41.100
I didn't let you know I was around.

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:44.900
Uh...

00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:46.620
You're Pong, right?

00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:49.340
Wait,

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.020
you know me?

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.380
Oh, yes.

00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.940
Jet has told me about you.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:03.220
Uh...

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.220
Are you going to see Prim upstairs?

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:10.380
No.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:11.900
I think...

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.100
I'll wait here.

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.980
The view here...

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:18.740
is so nice and...

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:20.740
easy on the eyes.

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:27.500
Well,

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:30.780
- okay. I'll get you some water.
- Hey.

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.180
I'm good.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:36.900
Anyway,

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.260
what's your name?

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.300
I'm Khem.

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.420
Khem?

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:46.140
That's a beautiful name.

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:49.940
Nice to meet you.

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:04.620
Hold on...

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:26.780
All done.

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:28.060
Thank you.

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:29.940
So,

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:33.420
are you a Master's disciple like Jet?

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.860
I'm not.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:37.060
It's my semester break,

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.180
so I'm here with Jet.

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.220
That's great.

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.540
I can come here often now

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.860
and get you something.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:47.900
By the way, what do you like to eat?

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:54.060
You seem a bit gloomy, Pong.

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:01.100
There's a chance of getting hurt,

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:04.460
so make sure to pray regularly.

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:08.740
Hi, Master.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:10.380
Anyway,

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.480
you also look kinda worn out.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.660
Did you have enough sleep?

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:21.660
Pong,

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:24.100
are you seriously
messing with Master, too?

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:28.460
So, see you later.

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:29.660
Okay.

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.140
Goodbye, Master.

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:43.860
I'll see you soon.

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:46.140
Have a safe ride.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:47.900
Pong,

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:49.700
are you coming?

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.020
Start the car, please.

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:52.460
Okay.

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:56.660
Bye.

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.420
Charn's almost done with his practice.

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.540
Go make him some lunch.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:42.860
Yes, Master.

01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:45.220
As for my lunch,

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:50.580
keep it covered.

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:52.940
I'll eat it later.

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:09.340
If you don't eat it,

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:10.680
you'll be in trouble.

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.820
Come on, what's with that smile?

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:29.340
You barely got out of the car.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.540
Stop saying that to your brother.

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.700
Now that you have a reason
to come here often,

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.740
that's good for you too, isn't it?

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:40.860
Are you happy that I came today?

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:41.900
Yes, Dad.

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:45.140
Thank you so much for accepting Master.

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.420
Yeah.

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.260
You'd better think it through.

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.620
I really love him, Dad.

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:56.780
No matter what,

01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.580
I'll win his heart.

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:00.620
Exactly! That's right.

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:02.980
Good.

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.780
I'm getting on in years now.

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.180
I want a grandchild!

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:11.260
What a classic boomer line.

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:13.140
How many, Dad?

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:14.500
You'll need to give me some, too.

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:24.180
What do you think?

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.540
Is his intention good or bad?

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:29.420
I don't think it's bad,

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.300
but I'm not sure if it's good.

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.460
Should we let Master know about it?

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:45.580
Picture this.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.340
"There's a chance of getting hurt,

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.100
so make sure to pray regularly."

01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:58.780
See?

01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:01.260
I'm sure he was jealous.

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:05.380
Quit it.

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:07.420
Master probably thought

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.460
Pong was going too far.

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.380
No, I mean...

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.220
it was like a scene from a movie.

01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:15.660
Like...

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.980
acting like he belongs to him
now that someone shows up.

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.140
He has no feelings for Khem,

01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:26.140
but Khem's also his?

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:27.180
Is that what you're saying?

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.820
Is the master you know

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.100
that possessive and irrational?

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:39.740
So,

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.900
was that Pong guy

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:43.660
really flirty, Khem?

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.380
Well,

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:48.840
I don't know,

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:52.340
but his gestures and words
seemed unusual.

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:53.180
Come on.

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:55.380
You had dust in your hair.

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:56.700
I would've taken it off for you, too.

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:57.740
Jet,

01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.740
if you didn't feel anything,

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:02.380
would you really touch someone's hair
while looking at them?

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:18.260
Alright.

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:22.220
Other than approaching too fast,

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.460
he seems like a decent guy, right?

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:26.780
Hey,

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:29.300
how can you change your ship now?

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.940
I never cared
about any of that shipping stuff.

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.100
Think about it.

01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:38.740
Khem's trying to move on,

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.740
and someone's approaching him.

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:43.620
It wouldn't hurt for Khem

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:45.060
to consider him, right?

01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.660
Are you seriously a psychology major?

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:52.140
Is it that easy to change who you like?

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:54.820
Exactly, I'm a psychology major,

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:57.420
- so I know a theory by Robert Stern...
- Stop that.

01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:58.940
We're on a semester break.

01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:00.300
No lectures here.

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:02.660
To sum it up,

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.660
love consists of intimacy,

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:05.980
passion,

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:07.580
and commitment.

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:10.820
Khem is close to Master

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:12.740
and attracted to him,

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.380
but they met not so long ago.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.220
Not much longer before Pong.

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:22.100
So there's no commitment
between them.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.939
But they've been in love
since their past lives.

01:08:24.979 --> 01:08:25.859
Jet,

01:08:26.979 --> 01:08:27.979
take it easy.

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:30.060
I've told you

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:32.620
our past lives
have nothing to do with this.

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:33.660
Of course they do.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.979
You've been in love
for almost a century.

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.420
How is that not commitment?

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:56.779
That's a promise.

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:06.180
You're shocked, huh?

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.859
Nothing to say?

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.660
You're wrong.

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:19.260
I was just...

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:22.340
thinking about
what you told me about Prim...

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:23.380
Prim?

01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:27.340
What's with her?

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.420
Jet?

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:34.220
Well,

01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:36.660
when she came,

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:38.140
I eavesdropped a bit.

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.620
It seemed like...

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:45.979
she was trying to get Master,

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:50.779
and he...

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:54.260
didn't seem to reject her.

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:08.940
Could it be that...

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.740
he still has feelings for her?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.140
Now, that...

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.500
is commitment.

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:24.260
In this life,

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.420
not from a previous one.

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:37.460
I see.

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:46.660
That's how it is.

01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.260
But...

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:51.380
why didn't you tell me that?

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.220
Well,

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:55.860
I was worried you'd still be sad.

01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.020
Sad?

01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:00.660
It's better this way.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.700
Like I said, I'm trying to move on.

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:04.700
I didn't ask you to do that.

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.260
Why stick your noses into it?

01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:11.980
We're sorry.

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:15.820
We just wanted to know
if Elder's intention was good or bad.

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.260
This time,

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:34.580
it seems like Prim's serious, Master.

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:38.660
Elder Chang even said
he wanted a grandchild soon.

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:43.580
♫If I have questions,
will you answer me?♫

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.220
That's up to them.

01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:48.460
But it involves you, Master.

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.300
Aren't you going to do anything?

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.500
Prim means no harm.

01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.060
It's nothing that needs to be stopped.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:13.620
♫If I weren't here,
would your tears fall,♫

01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:18.500
♫Or would my leaving
change nothing at all?♫

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:19.940
Now, that...

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:21.860
is commitment.

01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:25.290
In this life,

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:28.980
not from a previous one.

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:02.580
I hope you really think this over

01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:05.100
and see if you can give me a chance

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:06.740
I've never stopped loving you.

01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:08.140
What is it?

01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:10.180
Pong's taking me
to the temple fair tonight.

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.300
Make sure he takes care of you.

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:14.580
- If anything goes wrong,
- Hey!

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:16.380
he'll be the first one I blame.

01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:17.460
- What the fuck?
- Hey, hey.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.180
Hey!

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:21.020
What is that?

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:27.060
Thanks to all of you
for letting me have a fun time.

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.420
You won't get away with this.

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:34.250
♫If I were gone when the night falls,♫

01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:39.880
♫If you'd see me nevermore,♫

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:48.140
♫If I weren't here,
would your tears fall,♫

01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:54.860
♫Or would my leaving

01:15:03.570 --> 01:15:10.220
