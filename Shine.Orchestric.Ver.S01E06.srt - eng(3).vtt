00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.200
This is your eighth glass, Mr. Tanwa.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.120
I want more.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.080
Once this song ends, the bar will be closed.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.520
ends...

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.280
Yes...

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.280
It has ended.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.000
In the end, everyone is leaving.

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.439
When the time comes,

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.520
everyone has to go.

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:21.599
But if our bar is truly great,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.840
they will come back.

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.000
Take you time.

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:40.360
Gulping like this only makes the whisky lose its taste.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.439
The Washington Chronicle will be published soon?

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:17.560
Yes.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.639
You really don't want credit for it?

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.439
No, no. I don't.

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:24.920
Alright, your call then.

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.800
Thank you so much for your help.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.800
It's just the right thing to do.

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.000
(Dear readers, in the song "Gone Days," the lyrics say:)

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.839
(I miss the way things used to be.)

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:04.240
(I keep on playing yesterday.)

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.040
Your mind must still be in Nakorn Chaisri.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.120
Did you fight with your mom?

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.920
No.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.079
Your friend, Mr. Padoem's son,

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:41.079
was here the other day. He asked to see you.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.839
Have you two met?

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:47.120
Yes.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.160
Klai Rung and Sarasawadee

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.360
must have quitted writing the columns.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.800
We haven't seen their letters for quite a while.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.240
Here,

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:18.959
fried egg and ham are still hot.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.879
I'm sorry but I need to go now.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.000
Trin, have this—

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.639
I'm also running late.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.199
Excuse me, Aunt Dhevi.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.639
Good bye.

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:54.680
Is the new set of photos alright?

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:56.040
Yes, I think so.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.360
The Washington Chronicle

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.160
just published the Huay Kam Saeng story.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.639
They’ve got the full details—

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:08.360
including the death of the village chief.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.600
What?

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.079
Who's their source?

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:12.600
The students?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.160
Chief,

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:15.519
Chief,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.600
The Prime Minister has ordered

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.759
the temporary suspension of the Huay Kam Saeng project.

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:24.720
The US press just loves to sensationalize stories

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.560
like this from third-world countries.

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:27.800
Chief.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.480
Everyone, back to work!

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:33.680
Ran,

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.319
you—come with me!

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.120
Back to work, guys.

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:03.079
Is it you?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.040
I remember—you’ve got a friend

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.519
at the Washington Chronicle.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.360
Did you just defy my order?

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.800
I could put you on probation—

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.000
or fire you right now, you know?

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:19.480
But you won’t do it, because you know it’s wrong.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.120
Don’t you remember

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.079
when Boon had to exile himself to Japan—

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:22.800
because of your article?

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.560
Do you realize how many more people

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.000
will suffer from the consequences of your actions?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.600
Are you afraid for them, or for yourself?

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.879
I swear—

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.039
if anything goes wrong,

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.039
I’ll be the one to take sole responsibility.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.080
Do you think you’re some kind of hero?

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.600
That what you did will actually make the world better?

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.480
Didn’t you once believe in it yourself?

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.000
And yet you dragged the foreign press into this mess!

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.840
You actually think it will end that easily?

00:08:51.159 --> 00:08:54.399
This case is far more complicated than you imagine.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.480
I always see you as my junior.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.200
Don’t let your stupid audacity ruin you.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.440
I’m not afraid of being ruined.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.679
But I'm rather scared of living day by day

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.159
without ever committing to anything.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.879
Ran!

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:29.639
We've found it, sir.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.879
Umm. Thank you.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.159
Why?

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:39.039
Is my name in the news?

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.480
Yes, sir.

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:48.559
We could frame this as just the press’ speculation—

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.679
unsupported by any real evidence.

00:09:58.159 --> 00:09:59.200
Go back to work.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.960
Yes, sir.

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:21.080
An American newspaper

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.039
reported that General Pracha Suttisakol

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:26.879
and Colonel Krailert Suwannapas

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:28.879
might be involved in the accident

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:32.200
that killed the Huay Kam Saeng village chief—

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.720
the leader of the villagers

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.320
protesting the power plant project.

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:38.240
The project’s bid was won by a private company that has

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.480
recently been granted rights to use Huay Kam Saeng land.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.480
Mr. Padoem Chatbodi declined to give an interview,

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.480
while the Prime Minister

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.879
has ordered a temporary suspension

00:10:48.879 --> 00:10:50.799
of the Huay Kam Saeng project.

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:52.480
Chatbodi...

00:10:53.039 --> 00:10:53.960
Tanwa,

00:10:54.879 --> 00:10:57.120
your dad just made it into big news, bro.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.919
What’s that got to do with me?

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:20.240
Anyone who dares to make noise—shut them up!

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.159
Yes, sir.

00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:26.360
Here they are.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.840
General Pracha, may we have an interview?

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:35.639
General, sir!

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:43.799
Please stand back.

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:45.000
Please stand back.

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:01.159
Mr. Spokeperson,

00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:07.240
what are the facts of this case?

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:10.679
Please excuse me.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.039
Sorry—make way, please.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.320
Sir, can we have an interview?

00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:25.720
Sir, the people are waiting for the army's explanation!

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:26.320
I'm here to fetch my old guitar.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.639
I left it here.

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:28.840
"I'm worried"

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.879
Just say it.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.639
You must have seen the news.

00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:40.399
Just say you're worried about me.

00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:41.960
Try it.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.360
It's not that hard.

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:45.919
Oh.

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:47.840
What a pity.

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:51.240
I thought they’d already dragged you off to prison.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.480
In that case, I should’ve burgled all your possessions.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.559
Sounds good?

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.440
If I flinched at trivial news like this,

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.919
I wouldn’t have made it this far.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.960
Yesss. How clever!

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.960
You're so clever!

00:14:07.039 --> 00:14:08.960
Keep doing what you're doing, Mr. Genius.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.200
Thank you

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.799
for coming to see me.

00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:06.039
I'm worried about you.

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:08.360
I have to see you, no matter what.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.399
You've worked so hard on this project.

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:19.679
You must be so disappointed it's got suspended.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.279
No.

00:15:32.039 --> 00:15:34.120
If the project’s transparency remains in doubt,

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.720
then canceling it is only right.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.519
Poor village chief...

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:53.679
It should never have happened to him.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.759
This must not fall silent.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.879
His sacrifice must not be in vain.

00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:16.559
Are you free tonight?

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.639
Come with me.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.960
Rotisserie chicken!

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.639
Sizzling hot.

00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:32.120
- We’ve also got grilled beef. / - We ain't stop at this, yeah!

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.159
Yeah!

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:35.639
The village chief's death must not be in vain.

00:16:36.799 --> 00:16:38.120
I've made the plan.

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:39.840
We should have a meeting now.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.159
Wut, how are the pamphlets doing?

00:16:43.559 --> 00:16:44.440
Already sold out.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.279
Big win, bro!

00:16:46.519 --> 00:16:47.919
Hey!

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.559
Can’t I just drink and chill for one night?

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.360
No more power plant, you know?

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.360
What's the heck?

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.679
Narong's right.

00:16:57.919 --> 00:16:59.600
We’ve been at this for so long.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.519
We should celebrate the victory.

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:01.039
Yeah.

00:17:01.039 --> 00:17:04.160
Victory? Are you even using your brain?

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.759
The project is only suspended—temporarily.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.440
Only temporarily!

00:17:12.039 --> 00:17:14.000
The village chief was killed.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.759
That bastard Pracha is still untouched.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.759
Fuck!

00:17:21.799 --> 00:17:22.839
And that news in the foreign press

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.720
didn't affect them one bit?

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.799
I don't know.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.240
It may or may not affect the situation.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.640
But I must ask you,

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.119
Naran,

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:41.079
stop digging.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.960
The Huay Kam Saeng project is already suspended.

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:49.039
Stop?

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.519
Are you ordering me to stop?

00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:52.720
Yes.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.480
Anything can happen.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.519
Are you threatening me?

00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:04.400
No.

00:18:06.079 --> 00:18:07.279
I’m asking you for real...

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.440
Did you kill him?

00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:11.680
Who?

00:18:12.079 --> 00:18:13.720
Huay Kam Saeng village chief.

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:16.440
Do you actually think I did it?

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.839
I don't know.

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:22.440
But seeing how obedient you are to your boss—

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:27.000
Naran,

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.480
I didn't do it.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.680
I'm sorry.

00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:36.640
That's okay. I understand.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.519
No.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.319
I'm sorry I have to go.

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:47.559
I'll see you later.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:55.839
If they stand on opposite ends like this,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.400
they're sure heading for a breakup.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.519
Who?

00:19:03.519 --> 00:19:05.519
Klai Rung and Sarasawadee.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.240
Ever since that letter about the song

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.480
"In the Aether of Love,"

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.720
Klai Rung has never responded to Sarasawadee.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.200
And Sarasawadee

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.640
stopped writing song critiques altogether.

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:21.400
Their fans now believe they’ve fallen out.

00:19:21.799 --> 00:19:23.119
Everyone’s heartbroken.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.200
Moira, why are you telling me this?

00:19:31.359 --> 00:19:35.000
Because I'm a fan of the 'Enveloped in Melody' column.

00:19:35.519 --> 00:19:37.079
I just felt the need to share.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.400
I don’t want them to simply vanish like this.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.839
We’ve got to keep exposing those bastards!

00:19:51.839 --> 00:19:52.960
Yeah!

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.000
In the latest pamphlet we fucking tore them apart.

00:19:56.599 --> 00:19:58.000
Cheers!

00:19:58.319 --> 00:20:00.880
But it’s all written off as speculation—

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.960
just like today’s news.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.960
bacause it lacks evidence.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.880
No evidence, no guarantee anyone will believe it.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.799
Victor, get your ass over here. We need to talk.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.359
Why the fuck did you bring him?

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.160
You know he’s Krailert’s goddamn nephew?

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:22.799
Have a seat, Prof.

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:23.720
So what?

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.640
Every military nephew’s a piece of shit, huh?

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.559
Why the hell can’t he join us?

00:20:29.559 --> 00:20:31.200
Are you still my friend?

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:32.559
Try this, Prof.

00:20:33.359 --> 00:20:35.000
How can you be friends with our enemy?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.920
- May I, Prof? / - Thank you.

00:20:38.319 --> 00:20:39.839
What the fuck’s wrong with you—

00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:42.960
did you turn queer or something?

00:20:44.319 --> 00:20:45.119
Huh?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.200
You still alright?

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.640
You still want to call me your friend?

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.359
Yes.

00:20:50.039 --> 00:20:51.119
I'm queer.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.519
So what—are you gonna ditch me over that?

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.359
Tiva,

00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:01.920
Who the fuck brought Krailert’s nephew here?

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.839
It was me.

00:21:06.279 --> 00:21:07.279
Why?

00:21:07.839 --> 00:21:09.400
We’ve got a meeting tonight.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.039
Why the fuck would you drag this elitist prick in here?

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.319
He's on our side.

00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:14.920
Bullshit! Who the fuck’s gonna believe that?

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.240
Hell, he might’ve helped kill the village chief himself!

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:22.440
- He’s obviously with his uncle. / - I'm on the side of justice.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.559
I’ve seen plenty of your kind!

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.799
Elites like you always crawl to whoever fucking wins.

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:35.000
You’re a goddamn chameleon!

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:41.119
- What's the fuck is wrong with you? / - Come fuck with this!

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.279
Victor! Enough! Stop!

00:21:52.359 --> 00:21:53.440
Does it hurt?

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.240
Don't do it again.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.599
I can take care of myself.

00:22:02.319 --> 00:22:03.400
Wait.

00:22:03.759 --> 00:22:05.680
So now I’m meddling in your business?

00:22:08.839 --> 00:22:09.960
No.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.680
I thanked you.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.000
But this is too dangerous.

00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:19.039
You'll get hurt for nothing.

00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:34.480
Victor.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.279
Aren’t you going to rub the balm on for me?

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.200
You can do it yourself.

00:22:49.599 --> 00:22:51.559
But I want you to do it for me.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.519
Let's go.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.480
I'm taking you home.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.480
Phi Trin.

00:23:56.599 --> 00:23:57.880
I love you.

00:25:00.039 --> 00:25:00.920
Let's go.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.640
I'm taking you home.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.039
Thank you, Phi,

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.839
for making it clear.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.319
Thank you too.

00:25:34.519 --> 00:25:35.799
One day,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.720
I'll be good enough for you to love me.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.200
You're good enough.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.920
But goodness and love,

00:25:57.319 --> 00:25:58.799
they’re not the same thing.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.200
Let's go.

00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:11.200
I'm taking you home.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.720
Can I hold you?

00:26:56.119 --> 00:26:57.440
Victor...

00:26:57.799 --> 00:26:59.400
As your "nong," your brother.

00:27:41.759 --> 00:27:43.400
Thank you for everything.

00:29:21.279 --> 00:29:23.119
Have the fried dough first, Trin.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.880
Thank you, Aunt Dhevi.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.200
Absent-minded again?

00:29:36.599 --> 00:29:38.440
Don't you want to tear the dough first?

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.480
I’d rather let them stay together.

00:29:55.359 --> 00:29:57.160
Did Uncle skip his breakfast again?

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.039
Yes.

00:30:04.319 --> 00:30:05.880
Your uncle’s probably tied up trying

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.759
to straighten out the Huay Kam Saeng case.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.920
Anything else happened, Aunt Dhevi?

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.119
I'm worried about your uncle, Trin.

00:30:24.119 --> 00:30:25.960
He ate only three spoonfuls of rice

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.720
before they dragged him off to work.

00:30:30.839 --> 00:30:32.680
And those students...

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.000
Why do they keep stirring up trouble?

00:30:42.039 --> 00:30:43.440
What are they doing now?

00:30:44.359 --> 00:30:45.799
They're handing out flyers

00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:48.559
that slam the government to people on the streets.

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:51.000
When the police tried to stop them,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.720
the students called in their friends for back up.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.000
They must be clashing right now.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.680
Trin!

00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:04.240
Trin!

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:16.400
(People Are Not Stupid)

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.240
We are not stupid!

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.759
(No to Capitalists)

00:31:19.759 --> 00:31:22.680
Who killed the village chief?

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.599
Don’t hide the truth from the people!

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:30.359
Stay clear of Huay Kam Saeng!

00:31:33.119 --> 00:31:36.160
Did the village chief really die in an “accident”?

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.279
(Murder to Silence)

00:31:41.279 --> 00:31:44.319
Everyone has the right to know! Give us the truth!

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.240
Don't hide the truth from us!

00:31:47.079 --> 00:31:48.039
Everyone!

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.119
All we want is the truth—

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.759
how the village chief died,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.039
and who's behind all this!

00:32:00.039 --> 00:32:01.440
Who's behind all this!

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.359
Who's behind all this!

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:05.119
Who's behind all this!

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:06.720
Who's behind all this!

00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:08.000
Who's behind all this!

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.119
All protesters!

00:32:10.119 --> 00:32:11.480
Cease the protest immediately!

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.400
and leave this area at once!

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.039
Anyone defying this order—

00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:17.440
the officers are commanded to enforce the law

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.200
to bring the situation under control.

00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:25.119
Hey! What the hell are you doing? We haven't done anything!

00:32:30.519 --> 00:32:33.079
Students!

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:34.720
Who gave the orders?

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.319
Those in power!

00:32:36.599 --> 00:32:38.000
Who do they protect?

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.400
The government!

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.799
Who stays silent?

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:42.400
The press!

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.480
Who died?

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.799
The people!

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.400
Move out!

00:32:58.839 --> 00:33:02.759
I repeat—cease the protest and leave this area at once!

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.920
Who killed the Huay Kam Saeng village chief?

00:33:10.319 --> 00:33:11.279
It’s fucking them!

00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:12.160
Go!

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.400
Ready!

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.440
(Murder to Silence)

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.720
Go! Get out!

00:33:58.799 --> 00:33:59.960
Go! Quick!

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.799
Go!

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.480
Don't harm the people!

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:43.960
Prof!

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:46.840
Prof!

00:34:47.039 --> 00:34:48.199
Prof!

00:34:48.599 --> 00:34:49.639
Prof!

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.119
Prof!

00:34:55.079 --> 00:34:56.400
The police are using weapons!

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.400
You must run—now!

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.760
I still couldn't find Victor.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.880
Victor’s still trapped in there!

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.840
Gosh my friend...

00:35:02.199 --> 00:35:03.599
You must go! I’m going back in!

00:35:04.639 --> 00:35:05.599
Go!

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.719
Go!

00:35:06.719 --> 00:35:08.039
Don't let them arrest you!

00:35:15.679 --> 00:35:17.079
Go! Run! Quick!

00:35:30.719 --> 00:35:31.719
Victor!

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.800
Victor!

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.280
Stop!

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.920
Stop!

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.440
Go! Victor—GO!

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.719
How’s it going at the protest?

00:35:40.119 --> 00:35:42.159
Sir—Mrs. Dhevi just called.

00:35:42.159 --> 00:35:44.920
She said Mr. Trin is at the protest site.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.400
Tell every news outlet:

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.880
no announcements until I make the statement myself!

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.880
Make sure all papers and channels are under strict control.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.880
This must not leak under any circumstances.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.400
Get the car ready!

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.800
We’re going to the protest site—now!

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.119
Quick!

00:35:57.119 --> 00:35:58.079
Yes, sir!

00:36:05.239 --> 00:36:06.719
All rise!

00:36:07.679 --> 00:36:08.679
Prepare arms!

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.039
Why are you here?

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.039
You're not in my line of command, Lert.

00:36:22.639 --> 00:36:24.559
But I'm the Assistant Chief of Staff.

00:36:24.559 --> 00:36:26.239
You know exactly who I’m speaking for.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.320
I'm asking you.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.480
Don't open fire.

00:36:32.559 --> 00:36:34.480
You can’t shoulder the weight of the consequences.

00:36:40.519 --> 00:36:41.480
Secure arms!

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.920
Have you seen Trin?

00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:54.559
Can you make sure he's not in the photos. I'm asking you.

00:36:58.039 --> 00:36:59.199
Fuck you.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.400
Have you ever thought about anyone

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.480
outside your own fucking circle?

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.440
I was stupid enough to think you cared about the people—

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.320
but you’re only here to save your goddamn nephew.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.800
Privates!

00:37:12.559 --> 00:37:14.039
Go find Mr. Trin—

00:37:14.199 --> 00:37:16.280
and make sure no one gets into this area.

00:37:16.679 --> 00:37:17.679
Yes, sir!

00:37:18.199 --> 00:37:19.079
Do it!

00:37:19.719 --> 00:37:21.199
Take me to the prison!

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.159
Since you’re here to throw me in jail anyway!

00:37:26.039 --> 00:37:26.880
Naran—

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:28.599
Calm down.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.960
Calm down?

00:37:31.159 --> 00:37:32.920
How dare you tell me to calm down?

00:37:33.199 --> 00:37:33.920
What the fuck have you done

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.199
to the lives of those innocent people?

00:37:35.199 --> 00:37:36.800
And now you're telling me to calm down?!

00:37:37.079 --> 00:37:37.920
Hah!

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.360
Do it!

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.519
Put me in jail!

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.880
Other people’s lives don’t mean shit to you anyway.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.760
You don’t care if they’re beaten, injured, or killed—

00:37:51.679 --> 00:37:53.639
because they are not your nephew!

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.400
I only do what's necessary.

00:37:59.719 --> 00:38:00.599
Right.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.800
Fucking “necessary.”

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.639
You sent your men to protect your nephew.

00:38:06.559 --> 00:38:08.400
But what about the students?

00:38:09.559 --> 00:38:10.880
Don't they have parents?

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.599
Don’t they have families

00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:13.159
who care about them just like you care about him?

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.800
You're

00:38:17.679 --> 00:38:19.440
fucking selfish!

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.199
Yes,

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:22.960
I'm fucking selfish!

00:38:23.519 --> 00:38:25.559
I care about the ones I love, and I’ll do whatever it takes

00:38:25.559 --> 00:38:26.920
to protect them.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:33.960
Fuck it!

00:38:34.119 --> 00:38:35.280
Fuck all of it!

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.039
Naran—

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:42.559
I'm sorry.

00:38:46.599 --> 00:38:47.719
I've had enough.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.639
Go! Victor!

00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:21.159
I told you to stop!

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.760
Stop!

00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:34.199
Calm down.

00:39:35.159 --> 00:39:38.880
Breathe.

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:56.840
They went that way!

00:40:00.599 --> 00:40:01.480
Go!

00:40:09.719 --> 00:40:10.800
They're gone.

00:40:11.159 --> 00:40:12.199
They're gone.

00:40:12.639 --> 00:40:13.760
They're gone.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.000
It's okay now.

00:40:21.199 --> 00:40:22.400
Thank you, Phi.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.920
I'd help you anyway.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.599
Thank you for worrying about me.

00:41:23.159 --> 00:41:24.159
Veera.

00:41:25.039 --> 00:41:26.000
Mr. Trin.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.840
The colonel sent a car to pick you up in front.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.840
Sir,

00:41:47.119 --> 00:41:48.440
we've found Mr. Trin.

00:41:48.599 --> 00:41:49.599
Is he safe?

00:41:49.599 --> 00:41:50.639
Yes, he is.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.599
Did we manage to arrest the leaders?

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.880
We couldn’t get hold of them.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.760
Take the injured to the hospital.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.320
Today—everyone must make it out safe.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.760
Yes, sir.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.000
I almost didn't make it here.

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:25.079
They closed down the road to crush the mob.

00:42:28.519 --> 00:42:32.440
Can violence ever bring about real change?

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.519
Look at the U.S.—

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.639
hundreds of thousands marched against the Vietnam War.

00:42:46.039 --> 00:42:48.079
And what difference did it make?

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.119
The war still drags on.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.840
Even more fucked up than before.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.280
You won't get an answer from us.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.800
You should be asking the students.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.159
Today's protesters— they’re students?

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.519
Yeah.

00:43:14.079 --> 00:43:16.800
There's no real winner in war.

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.480
Yeah.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.960
But staying quiet

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.280
won't change a thing either.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.800
How are you?

00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:53.519
Is everything okay?

00:43:55.679 --> 00:43:57.280
I'll prepare your meal.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.280
No, you don't have to.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.519
I'm not hungry.

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.760
I'm taking a shower first.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.960
You can rest.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.280
How about Trin, Veera?

00:44:14.719 --> 00:44:15.920
He's safe, ma'am.

00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:19.440
Thank you.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.159
There’s a hole in your shirt—

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.199
on the sleeve.

00:44:32.679 --> 00:44:34.800
Oh, yes.

00:44:35.719 --> 00:44:37.840
Give it to me.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.360
I’ll ask the housekeeper to mend it.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.119
Please take care of it.

00:46:08.039 --> 00:46:09.440
When you’re home, tend to your wound.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.400
At least put some disinfectant on it.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.440
Otherwise it’ll turn bad.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.360
Yes.

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:18.840
Now go.

00:47:02.239 --> 00:47:03.320
Victor!

00:47:03.719 --> 00:47:04.880
You little dog!

00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:07.320
Do you have any idea I’m about to go into cardiac arrest?!

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.840
Did you get hurt anywhere?

00:47:12.559 --> 00:47:13.360
Hah?

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.079
You should really drop dead from cardiac arrest—

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.639
so Victor finally sees how worried you are!

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.880
Then maybe he’d stop screaming his lungs out

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.480
or letting himself get dragged around by the mob!

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.880
Who the hell’s dragging me?

00:47:24.039 --> 00:47:25.840
Stop it, both of you!

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.039
How about your friends? Are they safe?

00:47:29.519 --> 00:47:30.599
They’re safe.

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.440
I'll cook something for you.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.360
I’m cleaning your wound.

00:48:33.559 --> 00:48:34.440
That hurts!

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.039
So why the hell did you throw yourself out there

00:48:38.039 --> 00:48:39.199
and let them beat the shit out of you?

00:48:39.199 --> 00:48:39.800
Hah?

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.239
You go to college,

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.360
but didn't grow a brain.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:45.880
If you died—

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.960
would this country really be any better?

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.679
I'll take it from here.

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:00.760
Nuch, you'd better go home.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.920
I’ve done so much for you—

00:49:06.119 --> 00:49:07.880
and now you tell me to go home?

00:49:12.519 --> 00:49:13.760
Thank you, Nuch.

00:49:16.719 --> 00:49:17.880
But that's enough.

00:49:20.199 --> 00:49:21.840
It won’t work.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.639
I don't like girls.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.599
And you know that.

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.280
I'll be back, Mom. Don't worry.

00:50:12.599 --> 00:50:13.840
Please pull up here.

00:50:25.519 --> 00:50:27.519
I’ll walk back on my own. You can go now.

00:50:27.519 --> 00:50:29.039
But sir, it’s an order from Colonel Krailert.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.719
I'll tell him myself.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:34.800
Yes, sir.

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.599
Prof!

00:52:45.599 --> 00:52:47.119
Prof! Help me!

00:53:52.039 --> 00:53:53.159
Trin,

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.199
are you okay?

00:54:03.519 --> 00:54:04.960
Erm... Aunt Dhevi, this is—

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.760
I remember. He's Mr. Padoem's son.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.559
He came to see you here before.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.519
My name is Tanwa.

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:15.599
I see.

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.280
Trin,

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:23.719
it's lucky that you're safe.

00:54:24.599 --> 00:54:26.320
But don't do this again.

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:28.880
Don't risk youself like this.

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.639
If I'm at risk,

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.400
there are still people who’ll come and help me.

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.679
But those students... they can’t even protect themselves.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.679
Are you hungry?

00:54:51.039 --> 00:54:52.480
I'll prepare something for you.

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.599
I don’t think I can eat anything right now.

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:10.400
Sorry.

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.159
That's okay.

00:55:13.199 --> 00:55:14.920
You’d better get some rest.

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.920
Go upstairs to your room and rest.

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.440
Do you want to stay here tonight?

00:55:26.559 --> 00:55:27.400
Yes.

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.119
I'll prepare the guest room for you.

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.719
That's alright, Aunt Dhevi.

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.880
Trin, take a rest.

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:41.800
You must be exhausted.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.679
- Good night / - Good night.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.480
After I learned that Claire died,

00:56:02.519 --> 00:56:04.440
whenever I see the protest scenes—

00:56:05.519 --> 00:56:07.000
people running

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.079
some pushed to the ground—

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.639
I hear this ringing in my ears,

00:56:19.239 --> 00:56:21.000
as if every sound drowns out.

00:56:25.199 --> 00:56:26.760
I can’t breathe.

00:56:27.519 --> 00:56:28.760
My vision blurs.

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.119
And I know, deep down, those things aren’t really happening.

00:56:36.239 --> 00:56:37.719
but the pictures in my head...

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.480
they keep flashing again and again.

00:56:59.159 --> 00:57:01.000
I just realized

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.199
you've been through so much, Trin.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.519
You've been through that much.

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.679
Why did you put yourself back in that situation?

00:57:28.199 --> 00:57:29.239
I don't know.

00:57:32.559 --> 00:57:33.840
It just happened.

00:57:36.199 --> 00:57:38.239
Maybe I couldn’t stand the thought of losing anyone else.

00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.480
In the end,

00:58:00.239 --> 00:58:02.239
everyone leaves.

00:58:18.239 --> 00:58:19.679
I just casually folded those paper figures—

00:58:21.519 --> 00:58:23.360
but you placed them in such an important place.

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.480
Because they are precious,

00:58:47.639 --> 00:58:48.960
like the person who made them.

00:59:10.519 --> 00:59:12.400
When you said you made them casually...

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:15.960
was that true?

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.079
I made them

00:59:26.039 --> 00:59:27.880
because you're precious, Trin.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.039
What a beautiful song.

01:00:16.119 --> 01:00:17.280
What’s it called?

01:00:19.079 --> 01:00:20.360
I wrote it myself.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.280
No title yet.

01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:26.519
I want to hear it again.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.599
I haven't heard Trin play trumpet in so long.

01:02:20.119 --> 01:02:21.119
Do you like it?

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.400
I do.

01:02:28.639 --> 01:02:30.559
When I wrote it,

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:36.559
I thought of moments I can never go back to.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.559
It feels hollow—

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.639
but strangely warm.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.880
Like it’s telling me

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.239
how precious

01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:01.639
those gone days are for us.

01:03:14.679 --> 01:03:16.800
I want to stay here with you, Trin.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.039
...always with you.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.039
...everyday with you.
