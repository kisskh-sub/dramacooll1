You said you're not
in love with him.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.300
That's what I thought,
too, bestie.

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:22.233
He makes me feel different
compared to Vhal.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.133
I don't want him to go.

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.133
Once he patches things up
with Grandma Nadia,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.133
we'll never see
each other again, bestie.

He started to change
when we lost our parents.

You're so clingy, Nadia.

I kept waiting for him.

It made me wonder
if I was too much.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.500
And maybe that's why
he never came back.

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:52.267
I promised myself that
I won't give up on life.

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.767
He didn't mean any of it.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.267
He was just too angry
at the time.

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:01.300
That's why he said what he did.

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:03.833
Why are you defending him?

00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:06.833

what makes your case different

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:21.333
is that the person
who left you...

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:27.133

at death's door

bestie, but...

to accept that.
