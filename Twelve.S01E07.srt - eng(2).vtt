00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:16.558
{\an8}

00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:19.204
TWELVE

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.274
- Did I keep you waiting?
- Hmm?

00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:30.359
You're here.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:32.611
I just split up with my crew.

00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:34.613
Kangji?

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.991
Have you been watching us?

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:42.579
Let's go.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.455
Hmm?

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:09.166
Geez, sorry. How long was I asleep?

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.043
Sleep a bit more.
You must've been tired.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.671
I'm good.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:17.799
I doubt I'm more worn out

00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:20.093
than you angels who protect humans.

00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:22.596
All I do is spot evil spirits.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.181
Don't sell yourself short.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:25.932
Ogwi.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:29.186
The gift God gave you is special.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.354
If evil spirits
get past the magic barrier,

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.316
you're the only one who can detect
and find the soul stones.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.235
But will I be able to uphold my duty?

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.405
I failed to spot them again.

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:42.491
That doesn't mean you lack power.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.952
Even the necklace reacted.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.706
I don't know what's going on.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.333
This time, the evil spirit vanished

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.002
just moments after I sensed its presence.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.671
Also, I don't know why,

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:00.008
but I feel like I'm being watched.

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.344
Don't worry too much.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:06.431
We're all trying hard
to fight off evil spirits,

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:08.141
and whatever happens,

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:10.435
I'll protect you.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:17.818
You know,

00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:20.153
I've started praying.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.615
You said it yourself. Marok is human,

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.952
but he was granted his powers
after long years of praying.

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:31.081
When I gain power like Marok's
to vanquish evil spirits,

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.166
I'll be able to live among the angels,

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.794
and we'll never have
to be separated again.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.546
Don't do it.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.131
Don't even think about it.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.093
What?

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:48.640
Don't try to change for me
by saying dangerous prayers.

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:50.141
I don't want that.

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.853
I like you
for who you are right now, Ogwi.

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:55.105
Why don't we

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.108
just tell everyone about us?

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.235
Don't be absurd.

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:03.113
They wouldn't understand
even if we told them.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.323
Why haven't you told them
if it's that simple?

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:07.450
So do you want to keep sneaking around?

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:09.160
That's why I'm willing to pray--

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:10.245
Stop!

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:13.331
You want to be an angel?

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:15.750
You have no idea

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.880
how dangerous it is to fight evil spirits.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.178
Sneaking around like this
is just as risky.

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:29.806
Kangji already knows about us.

00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:35.604
Mirr.

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.106
Have faith in me.

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:41.318
Even if God ignores my prayers

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:44.779
and the other angels disapprove of us,
nothing will change.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.034
My feelings for you won't change.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:01.671
Soon, the black moon will rise,

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:04.007
and the Hellmouth will open right after.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:06.593
Spread the word

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.095
and divide the angels.

00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:24.653
You're here.

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:09.155
I've started praying.
You said it yourself. Marok is human,

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:11.991
but he was granted his powers
after long years of praying.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:15.245
When I gain power like Marok's
to vanquish evil spirits,

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.580
I'll be able to live among the angels,

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.333
and we'll never have
to be separated again.

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.817
Are you the one

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:48.903
who's been hovering around me?

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.408
Why have you been watching me?

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:04.419
Because

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.422
I thought you might be different

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.966
from other humans.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.261
Why are you being foolishly stubborn?

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.972
It's not like God
will answer your prayers.

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:19.517
You're nothing more
than a powerless human.

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:22.479
Do you seriously believe

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:26.024
God would entrust a mere human
with ultimate power

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.903
that could shift the balance of the world?

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:32.947
If you wish to be with Mirr,

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.283
there's only one path.

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.662
Abandon your fragile human form

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:42.832
and gain power greater
than that of the angels.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.544
Rather than obeying the angels,

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.423
make them follow your orders.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.347
Want my help?

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:01.184
Who are you?

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:07.065
Humans call your god Light…

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:10.610
and me…

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:15.532
Darkness.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:18.868
Ogwi,

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.288
I'll grant you a new life.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:04.747
Why should I?

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:12.881
Tell me why I should do as you say.

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.048
Enough!

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:15.717
Those are his orders.

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:17.844
Have you forgotten

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:21.055
how you went from a mere human
to a being with power?

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:23.808
The scattered angels
have located the Hellmouth

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:26.060
and have begun to gather.

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:27.937
We can't handle them all,

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:30.982
but as long as we have Mirr's soul,

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:34.152
they won't be able to merge their powers.

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.820
Even at the Hellmouth,

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.239
they'll be helpless.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.451
- If we don't stop them now--
- "We"?

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:54.297
"We"?

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:05.767
Know your place.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.020
You're nothing but a worthless high priest
who lent your powerless body

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:12.106
to Darkness and cast some petty spells.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:17.195
Don't you think it's absurd of you
to think that we're equals

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.906
just because we share a goal?

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.953
Don't get cocky and heed my words.

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:28.164
Your only task

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:32.669
is to take orders from me
and preserve that pitiful life you have.

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.171
From this point forward,

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.675
don't even try to walk in my shadow.

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:42.053
Keep your distance
and follow me in silence.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.806
It's been a while.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:31.686
Are you here alone?

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.355
Why did you betray us?

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:40.278
I asked why you betrayed us!

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:44.365
I got bored.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:46.868
What?

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.536
I grew tired

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.872
of being stuck within the fence
built by God.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.250
What about Mirr?

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.050
I only chose to live the way I want to.

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:04.969
Nothing has changed.

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:08.473
What are you doing?

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:09.682
Kill her already.

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:22.403
Come back with me.

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:24.614
Taesan will surely help you.

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:27.408
It's still not too late to ask
for God's forgiveness.

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:28.993
Forgiveness?

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:32.205
I prayed for countless days.

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:34.957
Your God is the one who abandoned me,

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:38.419
and your filthy rules
that divide angels from humans

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.255
destroyed my everything.

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:49.847
I'll ask you one last time.

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.642
Come back with me, Ogwi.

00:14:55.144 --> 00:14:56.979
For Mirr's sake.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.071
Stay still like that…

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:08.032
…for this is the last time
I spare your life for Mirr's sake.

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:21.212
Ogwi, no.

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.757
No, it can't be.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.092
No…

00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:28.094
No, you can't.

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:31.222
Ogwi, please.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.105
Mirr!

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:43.401
It's dangerous to go alone.

00:15:43.484 --> 00:15:44.610
Unbelievable.

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:47.196
Ogwi…

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:06.215
You fool.

00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:18.616
Why did you come back here?

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:22.411
Your memories…

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.247
are back.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.631
So much has changed

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:36.175
that I couldn't tell where I was anymore.

00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:39.261
This was the only place I could recall.

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.060
I'll get Chief.

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.940
Running away like last time…

00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:58.698
It won't do anyone any good.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:03.244
Will I be confined again then?

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:18.259
Why did you make such a choice back then?

00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:23.931
Why did you betray us
and stand with evil spirits?

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:25.307
I betrayed you?

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:28.602
That must be
how you self-absorbed angels saw it.

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:31.480
All I wanted was to…

00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:43.242
Forget it.

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:46.370
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.674
Mirr.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.481
TAESAN BUILDING

00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:37.087
Let's go.

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:51.727
Help!

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:54.563
Get them.

00:22:35.855 --> 00:22:37.147
It's okay.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.074
You need
to stick around for centuries more

00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:49.159
and keep protecting the innocent.

00:22:51.662 --> 00:22:54.373
I quit protecting humans long ago.

00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:55.624
You know that.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:58.669
If evil spirits return…

00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:02.381
…you'll protect us
like you did in the past.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.893
Take precautions to avoid damage,

00:23:13.976 --> 00:23:16.937
{\an8}and please stay indoors
for your own safety.

00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:18.105

{\an8}UNNATURAL PHENOMENON IN THE SKY
CAUSING PANIC

00:23:41.879 --> 00:23:43.005
It's a mess.

00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:54.516
- Stop the van.
- What? What about Mirr?

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.018
Pull over already.

00:24:12.326 --> 00:24:14.870
Chief, I smell something nasty
from over there.

00:24:45.693 --> 00:24:47.111
Got it.

00:24:47.194 --> 00:24:50.656
Don't kill the evil spirits.
We can turn them back into humans!

00:24:55.035 --> 00:24:56.286
Noted.

00:24:56.787 --> 00:24:57.955
I'll be gentle.

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:00.374
Be gentle!

00:25:29.319 --> 00:25:30.320
This way.

00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:40.247
I believe we paid back
the loan we took out.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.624
So what are you doing here, sir?

00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:43.917
Let us in.

00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:46.128
The boss isn't around right now.

00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:47.921
I'm not here for him.

00:25:48.005 --> 00:25:50.382
He really isn't here.

00:25:50.466 --> 00:25:53.010
- We need to get back there.
- Please come back next time.

00:26:30.089 --> 00:26:34.051
This liquor is very expensive
and hard to come by.

00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:35.302
Huh?

00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:36.637
Yangsu…

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.098
…is this whiskey or cognac?

00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:41.767
Hard liquor is basically whiskey.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.354
Alcohol was my major in school, babe.

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:47.648
- Were you in school?
- Of course.

00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:49.733
I was in school for 15 years,

00:26:49.817 --> 00:26:53.320
located in different parts of the country.

00:26:53.403 --> 00:26:55.072
You were in school for a long time.

00:26:55.155 --> 00:26:56.698
Was it a PhD program?

00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:00.828
Sora, shall we stop drinking now?

00:27:00.911 --> 00:27:02.996
- Hmm?
- Why? I'm loving it.

00:27:05.124 --> 00:27:06.416
What's with the ruckus?

00:27:07.084 --> 00:27:08.085
See what's going on.

00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:09.169
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

00:27:12.548 --> 00:27:14.133
What the hell?

00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:27.938
Who is this punk?

00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:29.690
- Move him.
- Of course.

00:27:29.773 --> 00:27:32.067
Nice punch.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.486
I told you Hyeonggyu
was a boxing champion.

00:27:35.237 --> 00:27:36.655
That was nothing, boss.

00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:44.913
Babe.

00:27:47.499 --> 00:27:49.793
What the hell?

00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:54.840
What the hell?

00:28:24.578 --> 00:28:26.747
Why? Where are you going?

00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:29.124
- Mr. Taesan!
- Babe!

00:28:29.917 --> 00:28:31.627
Something's off about them.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.211
Over there.

00:28:33.295 --> 00:28:34.630
Look at them!

00:28:39.635 --> 00:28:40.969
Look at their eyes!

00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:44.139
You'll take them on?

00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:17.589
Oh, what the heck?

00:29:25.222 --> 00:29:26.515
Kangji, are there more?

00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:28.350
That was all of them, Chief.

00:29:30.352 --> 00:29:33.397
Moving forward, I'll be at your service.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.023
- Don't be.
- Bow. What?

00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:39.027
I know a lot of boys
who could take out a loan.

00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:40.570
I like the sound of that,

00:29:40.654 --> 00:29:42.239
but stay inside for now.

00:29:42.322 --> 00:29:43.699
- What?
- Let's hurry.

00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:45.283
- Sure, Chief.
- Absolutely, boss.

00:29:45.367 --> 00:29:47.202
- Thank you, boss.
- Have a good one.

00:29:48.203 --> 00:29:49.871
- Bow.
- Got it.

00:29:49.955 --> 00:29:51.081
{\an8}SOBAEK CORNER SHOP

00:31:33.183 --> 00:31:34.226
Let's head back.

00:31:48.532 --> 00:31:50.742
Kangji, are you sure they're here?

00:31:50.826 --> 00:31:53.787
Yes, I'm sure.
The pendant is responding to the energy,

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:56.039
and I could never forget Ogwi's scent.

00:31:56.998 --> 00:31:58.375
He's around here.

00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:29.072
Bastard.

00:32:31.366 --> 00:32:32.868
Where's Mirr?

00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:35.245
She's in danger.

00:32:35.328 --> 00:32:37.330
Samin took her.

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:39.875
He likely left for the Hellmouth,

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:43.378
and with Mirr's soul,
he'll obtain real power.

00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:46.298
You're the only ones who can reseal

00:32:46.381 --> 00:32:47.591
the Hellmouth.

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:51.052
I have a favor to ask.

00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:53.847
Please stall some time so I can recover.

00:32:58.768 --> 00:33:00.270
I'll take care of the rest.

00:33:03.607 --> 00:33:06.943

TAESAN ORIENTAL MEDICINE CLINIC

00:38:05.867 --> 00:38:08.244
How dare they set foot in here?

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.463
Hanu?

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.270
Our brothers and sisters…

00:38:34.354 --> 00:38:35.855
Chief, how…

00:38:36.439 --> 00:38:38.274
Guys?

00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:42.445
This isn't right.
How were they brought back to life?

00:38:42.529 --> 00:38:45.782
They appear to be under Samin's control.

00:38:48.034 --> 00:38:49.244
Summon your weapons.

00:38:50.286 --> 00:38:52.372
But Chief, they're our siblings.

00:38:52.455 --> 00:38:53.915
We need to stop them for now.

00:39:03.591 --> 00:39:05.468
I need to take care of Samin first.

00:39:06.469 --> 00:39:07.512
Hold them off.

00:39:07.595 --> 00:39:09.639
Still…

00:39:09.722 --> 00:39:10.932
Still, how could we…

00:39:12.058 --> 00:39:13.226
You heard Chief.

00:39:15.562 --> 00:39:16.938
Hold them off for now.

00:41:35.576 --> 00:41:37.286
Chief,

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:38.788
we'll be right behind.

00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:39.872
Sure.

00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:21.289
Hanu!

00:42:49.025 --> 00:42:50.026
Are you all okay?

00:42:50.651 --> 00:42:52.487
I can't bring myself to hurt Yangmi.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:53.988
Hanu's too strong.

00:42:54.072 --> 00:42:55.323
Doni, keep him distracted.

00:42:56.115 --> 00:42:57.408
Stop them the best you can.

00:44:11.399 --> 00:44:15.695
Join me,
and you'll acquire even greater power.

00:44:15.778 --> 00:44:17.697
You'll be unstoppable.

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.918
How's that for an answer?
