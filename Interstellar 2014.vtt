<font color="#ffff00">WOMAN 1</font>: Well, my
dad was a farmer.

01:18.162 --> 01:20.621
Um, like everybody
else back then.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.917
Of course, he didn't
start that way.

- Nah, I got this.
- Crossing the Straights.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.016
- Shutting it down, Cooper.
- No!

<font color="#00FF00">[PANTING]</font> Sorry, Murph.
Go back to bed.

01:58.702 --> 02:01.204
- I thought you were the ghost.
- No.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.874
There are no such
things as ghosts, babe.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.210
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

02:08.628 --> 02:13.382
Maybe that's because Grandpa's close
to being one himself. Back to bed.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.551
Were you dreaming
about the crash?

02:16.970 --> 02:19.263
Get your butt back in bed, Murph.
Heh.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.792
<font color="#ffff00">WOMAN 1</font>: The wheat had died.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.962
The blight came and
we had to burn it.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.590
And we still had corn.
We had acres of corn.

02:54.758 --> 02:57.009
But, uh, mostly we had dust.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.056
<font color="#ffff00">WOMAN 2</font>: I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

03:02.224 --> 03:06.102
Just that steady blow...
of dirt.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.274
<font color="#ffff00">WOMAN 3</font>: We wore, um,
little strips of sheet...

03:11.441 --> 03:14.151
sometimes over our
nose and mouth...

03:14.319 --> 03:16.821
so that we wouldn't
breathe so much of it.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.033
<font color="#ffff00">MAN</font>: When we set the table,
we always set the plate...

03:21.201 --> 03:24.120
upside-down. Glasses or
cups, whatever it was...

03:24.288 --> 03:25.454
upside-down.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.129
Shake a leg! Murph,
get a move on!

03:33.297 --> 03:36.757
Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the
barn, Herbicide Resistance 101.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.426
- Check?
- Yes, sir.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.637
Not at the table, Murph.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.223
Dad, can you fix this?

03:45.809 --> 03:47.169
<font color="#ffff00">COOPER</font>: What the
heck did you do...

03:47.311 --> 03:48.477
- to my lander?
- Wasn't me.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.521
Let me guess. It was your ghost?

03:50.689 --> 03:53.024
It knocked it off. It
keeps knocking books off.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.711
<font color="#ffff00">TOM</font>: No such thing
as ghosts, dumb-ass.

03:54.860 --> 03:55.380
Hey.

03:55.392 --> 03:56.986
I looked it up. It's
called a poltergeist.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.404
Dad, tell her.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.489
Well, it's not very
scientific, Murph.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.992
You said science was about
admitting what we don't know.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.328
- She's got you there.
- Hey.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.996
Start looking after our stuff.

04:08.624 --> 04:09.832
Coop.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.795
All right, Murph, you
want to talk science?

04:15.756 --> 04:19.007
Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.
No, you got to go further.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.345
You got to record the facts, analyze,
get to the how and the why...

04:22.512 --> 04:25.431
then present your conclusions.
Deal?

04:26.099 --> 04:27.516
- Deal.
- All right.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.521
- Have a good day at school.

He should've planted corn
like the rest of us.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.215
Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley.
She's single.

04:59.383 --> 05:00.883
What's that supposed to mean?

05:01.051 --> 05:04.178
Repopulating the earth. Start
pulling your weight, young man.

05:04.346 --> 05:08.307
Why don't you start minding
your own business, old man?

05:15.607 --> 05:17.274
All right, Murph,
give me second.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.111
Uh-huh.

Shut it, Tom!

05:27.869 --> 05:30.204
- What'd you do, Murph?
- Ah, she didn't do nothing.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.873
- Blew a tire is all.
- Murphy's Law.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.042
Shut up!

05:35.210 --> 05:36.961
- Grab the spare, Tom.
- That is the spare.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.090

here? COOPER: You got to figure it out.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.722
I'm not always gonna
be here to help you.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.898
What's going on, Murph?

05:58.066 --> 06:01.277
Why did you and Mom name me
after something that's bad?

06:01.445 --> 06:02.820
We didn't.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.697
Murphy's Law?

06:05.657 --> 06:09.744
Murphy's Law doesn't mean that
something bad will happen.

06:09.911 --> 06:13.289
What it means is whatever
can happen will happen.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.000
And that sounded
just fine with us.

Get in, let's go.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.889
What about the flat tire?

06:32.851 --> 06:34.185
Yeah.

06:48.158 --> 06:52.161
It's an Indian Air Force drone. Solar
cells could power an entire farm.

06:52.329 --> 06:53.788
Take the wheel, Tom.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.586
Go, go, go!

07:02.172 --> 07:03.839
Keep that aimed right at it.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.183
Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

07:14.851 --> 07:15.893
Right at it.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.437
Stay on it.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.107
Here we go.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.236
Whoa.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.951
Nice one, Tom.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.792
Dad?

07:40.210 --> 07:42.962

Don't stop!

07:50.554 --> 07:52.888
You told me to keep driving.

07:53.723 --> 07:58.185
Well, I guess that answers the old "if I
asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.233
- We lost it.
- No, we didn't.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.581
Want to give it a whirl?

08:24.588 --> 08:25.963
This way.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.428
Go.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.432
Let's lay her down right there
at the edge of the reservoir.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.438
Nicely done.

it's been up there?

08:47.485 --> 08:50.029

08:50.197 --> 08:52.031
- ten years ago.
- Heh.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.283
So for ten years?

08:57.245 --> 08:59.872
- Why did it come down so low?
- I don't know.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.958
Maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.377
- What?
- Give me a large flatblade.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.464
Maybe some kind of signal?
I don't know.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.221
What are you gonna do with it?

09:16.139 --> 09:19.308
I'm gonna give it something
socially responsible to do...

09:20.185 --> 09:21.518
like drive a combine.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.604
Can't we just let it go?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.566
It wasn't hurting anybody.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.737
This thing needs to learn
how to adapt, Murph...

09:32.030 --> 09:33.530
like the rest of us.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.839
<font color="#ffff00">COOPER</font>: How's this work?
You guys come with?

09:39.996 --> 09:41.038
<font color="#ffff00">TOM</font>: I've got class.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.832
This one needs to wait.

09:45.377 --> 09:48.170
- What did you do?
- They'll tell you about it in there.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.506
- Am I gonna be mad?
- Not with me.

09:50.674 --> 09:53.842
- Just please try not to.
- Hey. Relax.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.595
I got this.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.142
Little late, Coop.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.852
Yeah, we had a flat.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.564
And I guess you had to stop off
at the Asian fighter plane store.

10:07.857 --> 10:11.443
No, actually, sir, that's
a surveillance drone.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.363
With outstanding solar cells.
It's Indian.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.115
Take a seat.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.742
So, uh...

10:19.452 --> 10:22.037
we got Tom's scores back.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.540
He's going to make
an excellent farmer.

10:24.708 --> 10:28.210
Yeah, he's got a knack for it.
What about college?

10:28.378 --> 10:32.131
The university only takes a handful.
They don't have the resources to...

10:32.299 --> 10:34.591
I still pay my taxes.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.760
Where's that money go?
There's no more armies.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.596
Well, it doesn't go
to the university.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.807
Look, Coop, you have
to be realistic.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.768
You're ruling my son
out for college now?

10:45.312 --> 10:48.814
- The kid's 15.
- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.984
What's your waistline?
About what, 32?

10:52.402 --> 10:53.502
About a 33 inseam?

10:53.514 --> 10:56.071
I'm not sure I see
what you're getting at.

10:56.239 --> 11:00.659
It takes two numbers to measure your ass
but only one to measure my son's future?

11:01.536 --> 11:04.413
Come on. You're a
well-educated man, Coop.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.540
- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

11:07.042 --> 11:11.795
Okay, well, right now we
don't need more engineers.

11:12.255 --> 11:16.592
We didn't run out of television screens
and planes. We ran out of food.

11:16.926 --> 11:20.346
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.890
- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.

11:23.808 --> 11:27.728
We're a caretaker generation, Coop.
And things are getting better.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.925
Maybe your grandkids
will get to be engin...

11:29.937 --> 11:31.023
Are we done here, sir?

11:32.317 --> 11:33.400
No.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.403
Miss Hanley's here
to talk about Murph.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.281
<font color="#ffff00">HANLEY</font>: Murph is a great kid.
She's really bright.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.700
But she's been having a
little trouble lately.

11:41.868 --> 11:45.245
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.915
Yeah, it's one of
my old textbooks.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.376
She always loved the pictures.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.254
It's an old federal textbook. We've
replaced them with the corrected versions.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.464
Corrected?

11:55.632 --> 11:59.760
Explaining how the Apollo missions were
faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.435
You don't believe we
went to the moon?

12:09.562 --> 12:11.563
It was a brilliant
piece of propaganda.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.566
The Soviets bankrupted
themselves pouring resources...

12:14.734 --> 12:16.985
into rockets and other
useless machines.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.237
"Useless machines."

12:18.405 --> 12:22.491
If we don't want a repeat of the excess and
wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

12:22.659 --> 12:26.453
we need to teach our kids about this
planet, not tales of leaving it.

12:27.288 --> 12:31.291
One of those useless machines they
used to make was called an MRI.

12:31.668 --> 12:35.003
If we had any of those left, the
doctors would've been able to find...

12:35.171 --> 12:38.924
the cyst in my wife's brain before
she died instead of afterwards.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.177
Then she'd have been the one
listening to this instead of me...

12:42.345 --> 12:45.431
which would have been a good
thing, because she was always...

12:46.015 --> 12:47.516
the calmer one.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.269
I'm sorry about your wife, Mr.
Cooper.

12:51.521 --> 12:55.190
But Murph got into a fistfight with
several of her classmates over this...

12:55.358 --> 12:57.025
Apollo nonsense.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.653
So we thought it best to bring
you in and see what ideas...

12:59.821 --> 13:02.489
you might have for dealing with
her behavior on the home front.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.743
Yeah, you know what? Um,
there's a game tomorrow night.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.037
She's going through a bit
of a baseball phase.

13:09.205 --> 13:13.417
Her favorite team is playing. There's
gonna be candy and soda and...

13:16.504 --> 13:18.338
I think I'll take her to that.

13:23.678 --> 13:24.928

13:25.847 --> 13:27.723

Coop, those combines you
rebuilt went haywire.

Just reset the controllers.

In case the ghost is
trying to communicate.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.530
I'm trying Morse.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.365
Morse?

15:08.700 --> 15:09.783
Yeah.

15:10.201 --> 15:12.828
- Dots and dashes, used...
- I know what Morse code is, Murph.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.914
I just don't think your bookshelf's
trying to talk to you.

15:27.510 --> 15:31.888
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset for the anomaly.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.725
- Which is?
- I don't know.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.645
If the house was built
on magnetic ore...

15:38.813 --> 15:41.898
we'd have seen this the first
time we switched on the tractor.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.738
I hear your meeting at the
school didn't go so well.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.073
Heh. You heard?

15:51.034 --> 15:53.869
It's like we've forgotten
who we are, Donald.

15:55.538 --> 15:59.041

not caretakers.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.377
When I was a kid...

16:02.545 --> 16:06.673
it felt like they made something
new every day. Some...

16:07.050 --> 16:10.344
gadget or idea. Like
every day was Christmas.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.472
But six billion people...

16:13.890 --> 16:15.891
just try to imagine that.

16:16.893 --> 16:19.895
And every last one of them

16:29.822 --> 16:34.201
You're the one who doesn't belong. Born
40 years too late, or 40 years too early.

16:35.203 --> 16:37.704
My daughter knew
it, God bless her.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.375
And your kids know it.
Especially Murph.

16:41.709 --> 16:45.128
Well, we used to look up
in the sky and wonder...

16:45.296 --> 16:47.673
at our place in the stars.

16:50.093 --> 16:54.471
Now we just look down and worry
about our place in the dirt.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.808
Cooper, you were
good at something...

16:58.142 --> 17:00.644
and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.771

to turn on you like

encountered one yourself.

31:39.273 --> 31:41.274
Yeah, over the Straights.

31:42.276 --> 31:45.319
My crash. Something
tripped my fly-by-wire.

31:45.487 --> 31:46.696
Exactly.

31:47.531 --> 31:52.451
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

31:52.619 --> 31:54.620
Out near Saturn...

31:54.788 --> 31:56.872
a disturbance of space-time.

31:59.001 --> 32:02.128
- Is that a wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.505
And it leads where?

32:05.048 --> 32:06.674
Another galaxy.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.678
A wormhole's not a naturally
occurring phenomenon.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.263
Someone placed it there.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.557
- "They"?
- Mm.

32:15.058 --> 32:19.145
And whoever they are, they
appear to be looking out for us.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.189
That wormhole lets us
travel to other stars.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.275
It came along right
as we needed it.

32:24.443 --> 32:27.361
They've put potentially habitable
worlds right within our reach.

32:27.529 --> 32:29.447
Twelve, in fact, from
our initial probes.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.991
- You sent probes into that?
- Mm-hm.

32:32.159 --> 32:35.161
We sent people into it.
Ten years ago.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.164
The Lazarus missions.

32:38.498 --> 32:39.778
<font color="#ffff00">BRAND</font>: Twelve possible worlds...

32:39.875 --> 32:42.209
twelve Ranger
launches carrying...

32:42.669 --> 32:45.087
the bravest humans
ever to live...

32:45.255 --> 32:47.882
led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

32:48.383 --> 32:51.385
Each person's landing pod had
enough life support for two years.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.512
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

32:53.680 --> 32:56.891
making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

32:57.059 --> 33:00.895
Their mission was to assess their
world, and if it showed potential...

33:01.229 --> 33:05.650
then they could send out a signal, bed
down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.860
And what if the world
didn't show promise?

33:08.487 --> 33:09.904
Hence the bravery.

33:10.697 --> 33:13.240
You don't have the
resources to visit all 12.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.533
No.

33:15.410 --> 33:18.204
Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary.

33:18.372 --> 33:20.937
Simple binary pings on
an annual basis give us

33:20.949 --> 33:23.417
some clue as to which
worlds have potential.

33:23.585 --> 33:25.378
And one system shows promise.

33:25.712 --> 33:28.255
One. That's a bit of a
long shot, isn't it?

33:29.091 --> 33:31.926
One system with three
potential worlds?

33:32.344 --> 33:33.928
No long shot.

33:36.098 --> 33:37.223
Okay.

33:37.933 --> 33:40.267
So if we find a home...

33:42.938 --> 33:46.399
- then what?
- That's the long shot.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.944
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

33:50.445 --> 33:53.406
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

34:05.127 --> 34:08.045
<font color="#ffff00">COOPER</font>: This entire
facility's a centrifuge.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.880
Some kind of vehicle.
A space station?

34:11.216 --> 34:12.967
<font color="#ffff00">BRAND</font>: Both. Plan A.

34:13.135 --> 34:15.219
How do you get it
off the ground?

34:15.387 --> 34:19.056
The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything.

34:19.391 --> 34:23.728
Suddenly we knew that
harnessing gravity was real.

34:24.062 --> 34:28.733
So I started working on a theory and
we started building this station.

34:29.109 --> 34:31.193
But you haven't solved it yet.

34:32.279 --> 34:33.821
That's why there's Plan B.

34:34.322 --> 34:39.034
The problem is gravity. How to get a viable
amount of human life off the planet.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.494
This is one way.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.330
<font color="#ffff00">Plan B</font>: a population bomb.

34:43.665 --> 34:48.418
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs weighing
in at just under 900 kilos.

34:49.129 --> 34:50.629
How would you raise them?

34:50.797 --> 34:53.257
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

34:53.425 --> 34:57.303
After that, with surrogacy, the
growth becomes exponential.

34:58.013 --> 35:01.307
Within 30 years, we could
have a colony of hundreds.

35:01.475 --> 35:04.852
The real difficulty with
colonization is genetic diversity.

35:05.479 --> 35:07.021
This takes care of that.

35:07.189 --> 35:09.648
But what about the people here?
You just...

35:10.025 --> 35:11.358
give up on them?

35:11.985 --> 35:13.235
My kids?

35:13.779 --> 35:17.114
That's why Plan A
is a lot more fun.

35:19.367 --> 35:22.244
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.830
You're asking me to
hang everything...

35:25.874 --> 35:27.208
on an almost.

35:27.751 --> 35:30.044
I'm asking you to trust me.

35:31.755 --> 35:32.963
<font color="#00FF00">[SIGHS]</font>

35:33.131 --> 35:34.799
Find us a new home.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.551
And by the time you return...

35:38.136 --> 35:40.805
I will have solved the
problem of gravity.

35:41.765 --> 35:43.349
I give you my word.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.488
<font color="#ffff00">MURPH</font>: Go away!

36:08.166 --> 36:09.208
Murph.

36:09.584 --> 36:12.586
<font color="#ffff00">MURPH</font>: Go! If you're
leaving, just go.

36:15.382 --> 36:18.217
<font color="#ffff00">DONALD</font>: This world was never
enough for you, was it, Coop?

36:19.052 --> 36:22.805
What, because heading out there is
what I feel like I was born to do?

36:23.765 --> 36:25.599
And it excites me? Heh.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.769
No, that does not make it wrong.

36:28.937 --> 36:30.062
It might.

36:30.438 --> 36:33.566
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.652
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.904
And the foundation's solid.

36:42.075 --> 36:47.079
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

36:47.372 --> 36:48.622
"Next year."

36:49.291 --> 36:52.960
Well, next year ain't gonna save
us, nor the one after that.

36:53.795 --> 36:57.923
This world's a treasure, Donald, but it's
been telling us to leave for a while now.

37:02.637 --> 37:06.432
Mankind was born on Earth, it
was never meant to die here.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.771
Tom will be all right, but you got
to make things right with Murph.

37:12.939 --> 37:13.981
I will.

37:14.941 --> 37:18.110
Without making promises you
don't know you can keep.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.748
You have to talk to me, Murph.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.377
I need to fix this before I go.

37:35.545 --> 37:38.422
<font color="#ffff00">MURPH</font>: Then I'll keep it
broken so you have to stay.

37:40.008 --> 37:45.012
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

37:45.388 --> 37:47.014
She said, "Now...

37:48.892 --> 37:53.395
we're just here to be
memories for our kids."

37:58.526 --> 38:01.028
And I think that now I
understand what she meant.

38:04.783 --> 38:08.535
Once you're a parent, you're the
ghost of your children's future.

38:10.163 --> 38:12.331
You said ghosts didn't exist.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.297
That's right, Murph.

38:23.510 --> 38:24.843
Murph, look at me.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.391
I can't be your ghost right now.

38:32.185 --> 38:34.186
I need to exist.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.731
They chose me.

38:38.441 --> 38:42.403
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

38:45.031 --> 38:47.533
That's exactly why you can't go.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.705
I figured out the message.

38:53.123 --> 38:56.333
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

38:56.501 --> 38:57.835
"Stay."

38:58.211 --> 39:01.088
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

39:02.048 --> 39:03.507
You don't believe me.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.468
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

39:06.636 --> 39:09.596
Why...? You're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"

39:09.931 --> 39:11.765
No, I'm coming back.

39:11.933 --> 39:13.267
When?

39:26.281 --> 39:28.741
One for you, one for me.

39:29.117 --> 39:32.286
When I'm up there in
hypersleep, or...

39:32.620 --> 39:35.164
traveling near the
speed of light, or...

39:36.166 --> 39:38.292
near a black hole...

39:38.752 --> 39:43.297
time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.675
When we get back...

39:47.802 --> 39:49.219
we're gonna compare.

39:49.387 --> 39:52.014
<font color="#ffff00">MURPH</font>: Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

39:53.099 --> 39:57.770
By the time I get back, we might
even be the same age, you and me.

39:58.146 --> 40:00.481
"What?" Imagine that!

40:05.028 --> 40:06.195
Aw, Murph...

40:06.362 --> 40:08.989
You have no idea when
you're coming back.

40:10.784 --> 40:12.284
No idea at all!

40:15.413 --> 40:17.539
Murph, don't... Don't
make me leave like this.

40:17.707 --> 40:19.208
Come on, Murph!

40:19.709 --> 40:22.044
Don't make me leave
like this, Murph!

40:29.636 --> 40:30.677
Hey...

40:31.221 --> 40:32.554
I love you.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.848
Forever. You hear me?

40:35.308 --> 40:38.519
I love you forever,
and I'm coming back.

40:44.317 --> 40:45.651
I'm coming back.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.046
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.257
Just fine.

41:14.722 --> 41:15.848
I love you, Tom.

41:16.391 --> 41:18.517
- Travel safe, huh?
- Yeah.

41:18.685 --> 41:20.936
You look after our place
for me, all right?

41:21.104 --> 41:22.729
- All right?
- Uh-huh.

41:27.235 --> 41:29.490
Hey, can I use your
truck while you're gone?

41:29.502 --> 41:30.612
You mean your truck?

41:32.115 --> 41:33.740
I'll make sure they
bring it back.

41:35.869 --> 41:37.661

he'd fit in better with his unit.

42:54.822 --> 42:56.490
He thinks it relaxes us.

42:56.658 --> 42:59.451
A giant sarcastic robot.

to be that honest.

48:50.636 --> 48:51.678
- Yeah.
- You all right?

48:51.846 --> 48:53.930
Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.

48:54.348 --> 48:59.019
We have some Dramamine in the hab pod, or
maybe in the cryo-beds. I'll just be a sec.

48:59.186 --> 49:01.354
- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

49:01.689 --> 49:03.523
- Bring a lot.
- Heh-heh-heh.

49:11.991 --> 49:14.868
Amelia, be safe.

49:15.202 --> 49:18.705
- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will, Dad.

49:18.873 --> 49:20.790
It looks good for
your trajectory.

49:20.958 --> 49:24.294
We've calculated two
years to Saturn.

49:25.046 --> 49:26.546
That's a lot of Dramamine.

49:27.256 --> 49:29.716
Look after my family,
will you, please, sir?

49:30.259 --> 49:33.053
We'll be waiting for
you when you get back.

49:33.554 --> 49:37.390
A little older, a little
wiser, but happy to see you.

So alone.

we won't find another one like her.

No, it's not like looking

50:54.677 --> 50:56.845
The human race is going to be...

50:58.556 --> 51:02.058
desperate for a rock it can cling
to while it catches its breath.

51:02.643 --> 51:04.477
We need to find that rock.

51:04.812 --> 51:07.522
And our three prospects are
at the edge of what...

51:07.690 --> 51:09.566
might sustain human life.

51:10.067 --> 51:12.527

Oh, uh, Wolf's a

None of them had families, huh?

51:32.256 --> 51:35.133
No. No attachments.
My father insisted.

51:35.301 --> 51:38.845
They all knew the odds against ever
seeing another human being again.

51:39.013 --> 51:40.973
I'm hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

51:41.140 --> 51:43.057
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?

51:43.225 --> 51:45.143
He's remarkable.
He's the best of us.

51:45.311 --> 51:49.689
He inspired 11 people to follow him on
the loneliest journey in human history.

51:49.857 --> 51:51.441
Scientists, explorers.

51:51.609 --> 51:55.695
That's what I love. You know,
out there we face great odds.

Death, but...

51:59.366 --> 52:00.700

52:00.993 --> 52:02.744
You don't think
nature can be evil?

52:03.120 --> 52:05.789
No. Formidable. Frightening.
But...

52:06.582 --> 52:08.583
- no, not evil.
- Hm.

52:09.835 --> 52:13.046
Is a lion evil because it
rips a gazelle to shreds?

52:13.547 --> 52:15.548
Just what we take with us, then.

52:16.091 --> 52:17.133
Yeah.

52:17.551 --> 52:19.636
This crew represents
the best of humanity.

52:19.804 --> 52:20.970
Even me, huh?

52:21.138 --> 52:23.139
You know what? We
agreed, 90 percent.

52:23.307 --> 52:24.390
There you go.

52:24.809 --> 52:27.185
- Don't stay up.
- I'll be there in a minute.

52:27.353 --> 52:31.397
Just remember, Coop, you are
literally wasting your breath.

52:38.072 --> 52:41.241
Hey, TARS? Let's go over that
trajectory one more time.

52:41.575 --> 52:43.243
<font color="#ffff00">TARS</font>: Eight months to Mars.

52:43.744 --> 52:46.579

Fourteen months to Saturn.

52:46.747 --> 52:48.164
Nothing's changed on that.

52:48.332 --> 52:50.416
Just let me ask you something.

52:52.670 --> 52:53.874
Dr. Brand and Edmunds...

52:53.886 --> 52:56.130
Why are you whispering?
They can't hear you.

52:57.591 --> 53:00.593
Dr. Brand and Edmunds.
They close?

53:00.761 --> 53:02.178
I wouldn't know.

53:02.346 --> 53:05.348
Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"
or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?

53:05.516 --> 53:08.643
- I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.
- Aah.

53:10.104 --> 53:12.272
But not a poker face, Slick.

53:24.618 --> 53:25.869
Hey, guys.

53:26.287 --> 53:29.372
Uh, Dad's about to go
down for the long nap.

53:29.707 --> 53:32.333
So I wanted to give
you an update.

53:32.501 --> 53:33.626
Uh...

53:34.169 --> 53:37.881
The Earth looks amazing from here.
Um...

53:38.424 --> 53:41.259
You can't see any of the dust.
Heh.

53:41.427 --> 53:45.555
Um, I really hope you
guys are doing great.

53:45.890 --> 53:50.143
I know you'll get this message. Professor
Brand's assured me he'll get it to you.

53:50.686 --> 53:52.729
Know that I love you.

53:54.148 --> 53:56.482
- Is it him? DONALD: I
don't think so, Murph.

54:03.365 --> 54:05.033
You must be Donald.

54:07.244 --> 54:08.411
Hello, Murph.

54:09.163 --> 54:11.164
Why are you in my dad's truck?

54:11.790 --> 54:13.958
He wanted me to bring
it for your brother.

54:14.710 --> 54:16.878
He sent you a message.

54:19.965 --> 54:21.966
She's pretty upset
with him for leaving.

54:22.134 --> 54:26.220
If you record any messages, I can
get them to transmit it to Cooper.

54:27.306 --> 54:29.974
Murph is a bright spark.

54:30.976 --> 54:33.519
Maybe I should fan the flame.

54:33.687 --> 54:36.272
She's already making
fools of her teachers.

54:36.440 --> 54:39.275
So maybe she should come and
make a fool out of you.

54:40.361 --> 54:43.196
- So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.

54:43.906 --> 54:47.909
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

Of course it is. What, you...? You
thought it would just be a hole?

58:12.865 --> 58:15.950
No, it's just that all the
illustrations I've ever seen, they...

58:16.493 --> 58:19.579
<font color="#ffff00">ROMILLY</font>: In the illustrations, they're
trying to show you how it works.

58:20.289 --> 58:24.125

- But it's too far, right?
- Mm-hm.

58:27.171 --> 58:31.966
So a wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through...

58:32.301 --> 58:33.885
a higher dimension.

58:34.052 --> 58:35.511
Okay, so...

58:35.846 --> 58:38.258

turned three-dimensional

58:38.270 --> 58:39.765
space into two dimensions...

58:39.933 --> 58:43.895
which turns a wormhole into
two dimensions, a circle.

three dimensions?

58:47.524 --> 58:49.025

Plan A does not work if the people on Earth
are dead by the time we pull it off.

it will take months to get there.

01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:02.588
And Edmunds', it's even further.

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:04.829
Miller hasn't sent much,
but what she has is

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.926
very promising. it's
water, it's organics...

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:09.261
- You don't find that every day.
- No, you don't.

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:11.764
And just think about the
resources, including time...

01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:14.433
that would be spent
trying to get back here.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.353
- Romilly...
- Yeah?

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:21.357
How far off from Miller's planet do we
have to be to stay out of the time shift?

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:23.192
Just back from the cusp.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.320
All right, which is here, just
outside of Miller's planet.

01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:28.280
<font color="#ffff00">ROMILLY</font>: Right. - Okay.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.992
Here's Gargantua.
Here's Miller's planet.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.329
Instead of taking the Endurance into
orbit around Miller's planet...

01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:38.374
which would conserve fuel, but
we would lose a lot of time...

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:42.628
what if we take a wider orbit around
Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet...

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:45.297
outside of this time
shift, to here?

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:48.259
Then we take the Ranger down, we
get Miller, we get her samples.

01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:51.136
We come back, we analyze, we debrief.
We're in, we're out.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:53.639
We lose a little fuel, but
we save a whole lot of time.

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.641
- That'll work.
- That's good.

01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:58.269
There's no time for monkey
business or chit-chat down there.

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:01.230
So, TARS, you should
definitely stay here.

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:03.649
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:07.403
If we're talking about a couple years, I
could use the time to research gravity.

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:10.531
Observations from the wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

01:05:10.699 --> 01:05:12.379
<font color="#ffff00">COOPER</font>: TARS, factor
an orbit of Gargantua.

01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:17.288

sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.

01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:19.999

wouldn't leave you behind...

<font color="#ffff00">CASE</font>: Yup.

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:31.969

- TARS talks plenty for both of us.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:34.221
Detach.

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:44.481
- Romilly, are you reading these forces?
<font color="#ffff00">ROMILLY</font>: it's unbelievable.

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:49.820
A literal heart of darkness.

01:05:53.992 --> 01:05:56.702
If we could just see the
collapsed star inside...

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:59.622
the singularity, yeah,
we'd solve gravity.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:03.334
- And we can't get anything from it?
- Nothing escapes that horizon.

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:04.835
Not even light.

01:06:05.003 --> 01:06:07.180
The answer's there,
just no way to see it.

01:06:07.192 --> 01:06:08.505
There's Miller's planet.

<font color="#ffff00">CASE</font>: Twenty-three years...

01:17:47.538 --> 01:17:49.247
four months, eight days.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:54.836
Doyle?

01:18:01.052 --> 01:18:04.054
I thought I was prepared.
I knew the theory.

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:06.931
Reality's different.

01:18:07.975 --> 01:18:09.142
And Miller?

01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:12.729
There's nothing here for us.

01:18:15.483 --> 01:18:16.983
Why didn't you sleep?

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:22.030
Oh, I had a couple of stretches. But I
stopped believing you were coming back.

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:25.533
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:29.204
I learned what I could
from the black hole...

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.040
but I couldn't send
anything to your father.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.459
We've been receiving,
but nothing gets out.

01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:36.711
<font color="#ffff00">AMELIA</font>: Is he alive? - Oh, yeah.

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:38.922

TOM <font color="#00FF00">[ON RECORDING]</font>: Hey, Dad.

01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:01.277
Checking in. Saying hi.

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:05.824
Um... Finished second in school.

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:09.828
Miss Kurling's still
giving me C's though.

01:19:10.121 --> 01:19:12.956
Pulled me down, but
second's not bad.

01:19:14.125 --> 01:19:16.292
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.921
Um... Oh.

01:19:20.881 --> 01:19:22.841
I met another girl, Dad.

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:24.592
I, uh...

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:27.345
I really think this is the one.

01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:31.224
Name's Lois. That's
her right there.

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.271
Murphy stole Grandpa's car.

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:39.607
She crashed it.
She's okay, though.

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:41.359
Hey, Dad.

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:43.611
Look at this!

01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:45.947
You're a grandpa.

01:19:47.366 --> 01:19:49.033
His name's Jesse.

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:54.289
I kind of wanted to call him Coop,
but Lois says, uh, maybe next time.

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:59.377
Donald says he's already earned the "great"
part, so we just leave it at that.

01:20:01.088 --> 01:20:02.380

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:06.759

Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:11.890
Sorry it's been a while.

01:20:13.267 --> 01:20:14.309
Just...

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.521
what with Jesse and all.

01:20:21.901 --> 01:20:23.401
Uh...

01:20:25.029 --> 01:20:27.363
Grandpa died last week.

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:30.867
We buried him out in the back
forty next to Mom and...

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:32.827
Jesse.

01:20:33.704 --> 01:20:36.789
Which is where we would have
buried you if you'd ever...

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:39.042
come back.

01:20:40.544 --> 01:20:42.795
Murph was there at the funeral.

01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:46.174
We don't see her that much,
but she came for that.

01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:51.804
You aren't listening
to this, I know that.

01:20:54.934 --> 01:20:57.685
All these messages
are just, like...

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:02.524
drifting out there
in the darkness.

01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:05.944
Lois says that, uh...

01:21:06.737 --> 01:21:09.489
I have to let you go.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.699
And, uh...

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:13.284
so...

01:21:16.539 --> 01:21:19.624
I guess I'm letting you go.

01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:23.253
I don't know where
you are, Dad...

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:26.506
but I hope that you're at peace.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.384
Goodbye.

01:21:42.982 --> 01:21:44.232
Hey, Dad.

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:48.236
Hey, Murph.

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:50.321
You son of a bitch.

01:21:54.034 --> 01:21:56.536
I never made one of these when
you were still responding...

01:21:56.704 --> 01:21:59.038
because I was so mad
at you for leaving.

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:04.168
And then when you
went quiet, it...

01:22:06.797 --> 01:22:09.632
seemed like I should live with
that decision. And I have.

01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:16.556
But today's my birthday.

01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:23.396
And it's a special one,
because you told me...

01:22:27.526 --> 01:22:31.863
You once told me that when you came
back, we might be the same age.

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:36.659
And today I'm the age
you were when you left.

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:41.748
So it would be a real good
time for you to come back.

01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:43.583

<font color="#00FF00">[SNIFFLES]</font>

01:22:56.221 --> 01:23:00.516
I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that
I've never seen you in here before.

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:03.311
I've never been in here before.

01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:08.191
<font color="#ffff00">BRAND</font>: I talk to
Amelia all the time.

01:23:08.692 --> 01:23:10.026
It helps.

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:13.446
- I'm glad you've started.
<font color="#ffff00">MURPH</font>: I haven't. I...

01:23:13.614 --> 01:23:16.115
I just had something
I needed to get out.

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:18.868
- I know they're still out there.
- I know.

01:23:19.036 --> 01:23:20.719
There are so many reasons their

01:23:20.731 --> 01:23:23.247
communications might not
be getting through.

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:24.832
I know, professor.

01:23:25.459 --> 01:23:28.378
I'm not sure what
I'm more afraid of.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:31.881
Them never coming back or...

01:23:33.092 --> 01:23:36.302
coming back to
find we've failed.

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:37.887
Then let's succeed.

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:39.972
So...

01:23:40.683 --> 01:23:44.686
back to the fourth iteration. Let's
run it through some new fields.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:48.189
With respect, professor, we've
tried that hundreds of times.

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:52.193
It only has to work once, Murph.

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:59.367
<font color="#ffff00">BRAND</font>: Every rivet that they
strike could have been a bullet.

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:01.536
We've done well for
the world here...

01:24:01.704 --> 01:24:06.457
whether or not we crack the
equation before I kick the bucket.

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:09.502
- Don't be morbid, professor.
- I'm not afraid of death.

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:12.088
I'm an old physicist.

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:15.007
I'm afraid of time.

01:24:22.182 --> 01:24:23.349
<font color="#ffff00">MURPH</font>: Time.

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:27.061
You're afraid of time.

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:31.649
We've been trying to
solve the equation...

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:34.318
without changing the underlying
assumption about time.

01:24:34.486 --> 01:24:36.195
- And?
- And that means...

01:24:36.363 --> 01:24:40.825
each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:43.119
It's recursive.
It's nonsensical.

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:45.329
Are you calling
my life's work...

01:24:45.497 --> 01:24:47.206
nonsense, Murph?

01:24:47.374 --> 01:24:49.417
No, I'm saying that
you've been trying to...

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:53.379
finish it with one arm... No, with
both arms... tied behind your back.

01:24:55.466 --> 01:24:57.467
And I don't understand why.

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:00.261
I'm an old man, Murph.

01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:03.806
Can we take this point
up at another time?

01:25:03.974 --> 01:25:06.100
I want to talk to my daughter.

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:10.730
BRAND <font color="#00FF00">[ON RECORDING]</font>: Stepping
out into the universe...

01:25:10.898 --> 01:25:14.692
we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.

01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:20.156
We must reach far beyond
our own lifespans.

01:25:20.324 --> 01:25:25.453
We must think not as
individuals but as a species.

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:30.917
Do not go gentle
into that good night

01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:35.671
<font color="#ffff00">COOPER</font>: TARS kept the Endurance
right where we needed her.

01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:38.633
But the trip took years
longer than we anticipated.

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:42.470
We no longer have the fuel to
visit both prospects, so...

01:25:42.805 --> 01:25:44.305
we have to choose.

01:25:45.516 --> 01:25:46.641
But how?

01:25:47.684 --> 01:25:49.352
They're both promising.

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:55.399
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann
is the one still transmitting, so...

01:25:55.567 --> 01:25:58.486
We've no reason to suspect
Edmunds's data would have soured.

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:01.906
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

01:26:02.074 --> 01:26:05.243
- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:07.453
And...

01:26:08.247 --> 01:26:10.414
I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:13.918
- Why?
- Gargantua, that's why.

01:26:15.045 --> 01:26:19.090
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

01:26:19.258 --> 01:26:23.678
but no life. Sterile. We'll
find the same thing on Mann's.

01:26:24.096 --> 01:26:25.763
Because of the black hole?

01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:29.100
Murphy's Law. Whatever
can happen will happen.

01:26:29.268 --> 01:26:31.602
Accident is the first
building block of evolution.

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:34.605
But when you're orbiting a black
hole not enough can happen.

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:39.068
It sucks in asteroids and comets, other
events which would otherwise reach you.

01:26:39.444 --> 01:26:41.279
We need to go further afield.

01:26:41.905 --> 01:26:44.240
You once said that Dr. Mann...

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:46.993
was the best of us.

01:26:47.286 --> 01:26:50.454
He's remarkable. We're
only here because of him.

01:26:50.998 --> 01:26:52.832
And yet... Yet here he is.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.962
He's on the ground, and he's sending a
very unambiguous message, telling us...

01:26:58.130 --> 01:26:59.839
to come to his planet.

01:27:00.007 --> 01:27:04.635
Granted, but Edmunds'
data is more promising.

01:27:05.095 --> 01:27:06.137
We should vote.

01:27:06.305 --> 01:27:08.472
Well, if we vote, there's
something you should know.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.641
Brand?

01:27:10.809 --> 01:27:12.476
He has a right to know.

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:14.729
That has nothing to do with it.

01:27:14.897 --> 01:27:17.940
- What does?
- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.

01:27:18.108 --> 01:27:20.651
<font color="#ffff00">ROMILLY</font>: Is that true? - Yes.

01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:26.532
And that makes me want
to follow my heart.

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:33.664
But maybe we've spent too long trying
to figure all this out with theory.

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:35.249
You're a scientist, Brand.

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:36.959
So listen to me...

01:27:37.794 --> 01:27:42.506
when I say that love isn't
something we invented. It's...

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:45.843
observable, powerful.

01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:49.639
It has to mean something.

01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:54.185
Love has meaning, yes. Social utility,
social bonding, child rearing...

01:27:54.353 --> 01:27:57.855
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?

01:27:58.398 --> 01:27:59.440
None.

01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:03.486
Maybe it means something
more, something we can't...

01:28:03.654 --> 01:28:05.696
yet understand.

01:28:05.864 --> 01:28:09.325
Maybe it's some
evidence, some...

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:14.747
artifact of a higher dimension that
we can't consciously perceive.

01:28:14.915 --> 01:28:19.710
I'm drawn across the universe to
someone I haven't seen in a decade...

01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:22.713
who I know is probably dead.

01:28:23.048 --> 01:28:26.384
Love is the one thing we're
capable of perceiving...

01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:29.387
that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:35.559
Maybe we should trust that, even
if we can't understand it yet.

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:42.233
All right, Cooper...

01:28:44.111 --> 01:28:45.403
yes...

01:28:46.571 --> 01:28:49.907
the tiniest possibility of
seeing Wolf again excites me.

01:28:50.742 --> 01:28:52.410
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.287
Honestly, Amelia...

01:28:57.082 --> 01:28:58.249
it might.

01:29:05.048 --> 01:29:07.758
TARS, chart a course for Dr.
Mann's.

Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's
farm and we'll make it up.

01:29:33.785 --> 01:29:35.619

exactly as you left it. it's ready.

Too many memories.

01:30:23.502 --> 01:30:25.336

Unless you're punishing me for
screwing up on Miller's planet.

01:30:49.986 --> 01:30:52.238
No, this wasn't a
personal decision.

01:30:53.073 --> 01:30:57.118
If you're wrong, you will have a
very personal decision to make.

01:30:57.285 --> 01:31:00.246
Your fuel calculations are
based on a return journey.

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:04.458
Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll
have to decide whether to return home...

01:31:04.751 --> 01:31:06.877
or push on to
Edmunds' with Plan B.

01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:10.881
Starting a colony could
save us from extinction.

01:31:11.216 --> 01:31:14.385
You might have to decide between
seeing your children again...

01:31:14.553 --> 01:31:16.387
and the future of
the human race.

01:31:17.889 --> 01:31:19.598
I trust you'll be
as objective then.

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:28.399
He's been asking for
you since he came to.

01:31:28.567 --> 01:31:30.192
We were trying to reach you.

01:31:36.158 --> 01:31:37.199

01:31:38.201 --> 01:31:39.702
I'm here, professor.

01:31:40.412 --> 01:31:42.746
I let you all down.

01:31:43.081 --> 01:31:46.417
No, you got us so far.
Real close.

01:31:48.253 --> 01:31:50.045
I'll finish what you started.

01:31:50.213 --> 01:31:52.423
Good, good Murph.

01:31:54.718 --> 01:31:57.011
You had faith...

01:31:58.221 --> 01:31:59.513

01:32:09.608 --> 01:32:12.401
I wanted you to believe...

01:32:13.904 --> 01:32:15.779
that your father...

01:32:18.783 --> 01:32:20.618
would come back.

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:22.077
I do, professor.

01:32:23.705 --> 01:32:25.206
Forgive me, Murph.

01:32:25.957 --> 01:32:27.958
There's nothing to forgive.

01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:31.670
I...

01:32:32.255 --> 01:32:34.089
I lied, Murph.

01:32:36.468 --> 01:32:38.260
I lied to you.

01:32:44.601 --> 01:32:47.811
There was no need for him to...

01:32:49.022 --> 01:32:50.898
To come back.

01:32:53.485 --> 01:32:56.820
There is no way to help us.

01:32:58.114 --> 01:32:59.156
But Plan A...

01:32:59.699 --> 01:33:02.826
All this. All these people.

01:33:03.954 --> 01:33:05.746
And the equation.

01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:11.502
Did my father know?

01:33:15.298 --> 01:33:17.007
Did he leave me?

01:33:20.971 --> 01:33:22.012
Do...

The gravity is a very, very
pleasant 80 percent of the Earth's.

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:24.958
Now, up here where I landed,
the water is alkali...

01:39:25.293 --> 01:39:29.046
and the air has too much ammonia to breathe
for more than just a few minutes...

01:39:29.213 --> 01:39:33.800
but down at the surface,
and there is a surface...

01:39:33.968 --> 01:39:35.594
the chlorine dissipates.

01:39:35.762 --> 01:39:39.640
The ammonia gives way to crystalline
hydrocarbons and breathable air.

01:39:39.974 --> 01:39:41.475
To organics.

We struggled on for a time, but
ultimately I decommissioned him and...

used his power source to
keep the mission going.

no idea what she's talking about.

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:02.115
<font color="#ffff00">MANN</font>: I do.

But he's been trying to solve the

01:42:20.718 --> 01:42:24.137
Amelia, your father solved his
equation before I even left.

01:42:24.722 --> 01:42:26.598
Then why wouldn't he use it?

01:42:26.766 --> 01:42:30.727
The equation couldn't reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics. You need more.

01:42:30.895 --> 01:42:32.813
More? More what?

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:35.982
<font color="#ffff00">MANN</font>: More data. You need
to see into a black hole.

If a black hole is an oyster, then
the singularity's the pearl inside.

always hidden in darkness...

beyond the horizon...

the species instead of themselves.

01:43:18.276 --> 01:43:19.442

extends beyond our line of sight.

01:43:33.457 --> 01:43:35.166

humanity in order to save the species.

01:43:50.308 --> 01:43:52.726
- He made an incredible sacrifice.

01:43:59.483 --> 01:44:01.651
Because in his
fucking arrogance...

01:44:02.069 --> 01:44:04.154
he declared their case hopeless.

find the other half?

Panic won't help. We just have
to keep working, same as ever.

But isn't that exactly what Professor

01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:21.481

still trying to solve this.

01:45:22.108 --> 01:45:23.191
So...

01:45:24.610 --> 01:45:26.277
do you have an idea?

01:45:26.988 --> 01:45:28.321
A feeling.

01:45:31.742 --> 01:45:33.743
I told you about my ghost.

01:45:35.746 --> 01:45:37.789
My dad thought I
called it a ghost...

01:45:38.249 --> 01:45:39.916
because I was scared of it.

01:45:43.379 --> 01:45:44.713
But I was never scared of it.

01:45:46.924 --> 01:45:49.592
I called it a ghost
because it felt...

01:45:52.013 --> 01:45:53.680
It felt like a person.

01:45:56.225 --> 01:45:57.892
It was trying to
tell me something.

01:46:00.855 --> 01:46:03.857
If there's an answer here on
Earth, it's back there...

01:46:04.316 --> 01:46:06.234
somehow, in that room.

01:46:06.777 --> 01:46:08.528
So I have to find it.

01:46:11.949 --> 01:46:13.700
We're running out of time.

01:46:15.619 --> 01:46:17.620

- Yeah?

01:46:21.876 --> 01:46:23.877
I have a suggestion for
your return journey.

01:46:24.045 --> 01:46:26.796
- Yeah, what's that?
- Have one last crack at the black hole.

01:46:28.674 --> 01:46:30.258
I'm going home, Rom.

01:46:30.426 --> 01:46:33.678
Yeah, I know. This isn't
going to cost you any time.

01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:36.264
There's a chance for
the people on Earth.

01:46:37.016 --> 01:46:40.060
- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:44.105
- It's what we call a gentle singularity.
- Gentle?

01:46:44.273 --> 01:46:47.734
They're hardly gentle. But the
tidal gravity is so quick that...

01:46:47.902 --> 01:46:52.155
something crossing the horizon
fast might survive. A probe, say.

01:46:52.323 --> 01:46:56.993
- What happens after it crosses?
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.

01:46:57.161 --> 01:47:00.246
So, what's to say there isn't
some way that the probe...

01:47:00.414 --> 01:47:03.333
can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

01:47:03.501 --> 01:47:06.753
If he's equipped to transmit every
form of energy that can pulse.

01:47:06.921 --> 01:47:09.714
<font color="#ffff00">TARS</font>: Just when did this probe
become a "he," professor?

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:12.008
TARS is the obvious candidate.

01:47:12.843 --> 01:47:14.761
I've already told him
what to look for.

01:47:14.929 --> 01:47:17.639
I'd need the old optical
transmitter off KIPP, Cooper.

01:47:17.807 --> 01:47:19.140
You'd do this for us?

01:47:19.308 --> 01:47:23.228
Before you get all teary, remember that
as a robot I have to do anything you say.

01:47:24.146 --> 01:47:25.605
Your cue light's broken.

01:47:25.773 --> 01:47:27.315
I'm not joking.

01:47:29.944 --> 01:47:33.196
I'll need TARS to remove and
adapt some components from KIPP.

01:47:33.364 --> 01:47:35.698
I don't want to disturb
his archival functions.

01:47:35.866 --> 01:47:37.367
I'll supervise.

01:47:37.701 --> 01:47:38.743
All right.

01:47:38.911 --> 01:47:41.067
Dr. Mann, we need to
find three secure

01:47:41.079 --> 01:47:43.581
sites. One for Brand's
lab, two for habitat.

01:47:43.749 --> 01:47:46.209
Once those modules have landed,
you don't want to move them.

01:47:46.377 --> 01:47:48.920
I can take you to the probe
sites, but I don't think...

01:47:49.088 --> 01:47:51.798
these conditions will hold.
I think we should wait.

01:47:51.966 --> 01:47:54.801

02:35:27.986 --> 02:35:33.031
Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.
Actually, you are 124 years old.

02:35:42.291 --> 02:35:44.584
You were, uh, extremely lucky.

02:35:44.919 --> 02:35:48.255
The Rangers found you with only
minutes left in your oxygen supply.

02:36:23.541 --> 02:36:26.752
The station isn't named after you, sir.
It's, uh, named after your daughter.

02:36:27.253 --> 02:36:30.255
Although she's always maintained
just how important you were.

02:36:30.423 --> 02:36:32.132
Is she still alive?

02:36:34.093 --> 02:36:35.969
She'll be here in
a couple weeks.

02:36:37.013 --> 02:36:39.473
She is far too old to be
transferring from another station...

02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:42.017
but when she heard that
you'd been found...

02:36:43.227 --> 02:36:45.937
well, this is, uh, Murphy
Cooper we're talking about.

02:36:46.814 --> 02:36:48.315
Yes, it is.

02:36:50.443 --> 02:36:52.944
We'll have you checked out
of here in a couple days.

02:36:55.615 --> 02:36:58.116
I'm sure you'll be excited
to see what's in store.

02:36:59.368 --> 02:37:03.330
I actually, uh, did a paper
on you in high school.

02:37:03.664 --> 02:37:05.999
I know all about your
life back on Earth.

02:37:07.668 --> 02:37:08.835
Oh, yeah.

02:37:09.003 --> 02:37:10.253

If... If you'll follow me, we've got
a really good situation for you.

02:37:21.349 --> 02:37:25.393
So, uh, when I made my
suggestion to Miss Cooper...

02:37:26.312 --> 02:37:29.106
I was delighted to hear that
she thought it was perfect.

02:37:32.485 --> 02:37:35.779

Just that steady blow of dirt.

02:37:35.947 --> 02:37:38.865
Of course, I didn't speak
to her personally.

Well, my dad was a farmer. Uh,
like everybody else back then.

02:37:49.210 --> 02:37:51.670
There just wasn't enough food.

<font color="#ffff00">MAN</font>: She did confirm just
how much you loved farming.

02:38:12.066 --> 02:38:13.733

Heh.
