01:06.291 --> 01:07.625
-Hey, Max.
-Hey, sis.

01:08.750 --> 01:10.125
-Morning, Grandma.
-Morning.

01:12.250 --> 01:14.291
Did anyone get the mail this morning?

01:15.291 --> 01:16.125
Nope.

01:17.791 --> 01:19.541
Emily, did you get the mail?

01:19.625 --> 01:21.708
She's watching The Honey Pot again.

01:23.916 --> 01:27.500
-Hey!
-Will you take the money or the honey?

01:27.583 --> 01:28.916
I take the honey!

01:30.375 --> 01:33.500
-You're obsessed.
-I got the mail this morning.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.916
It's from France.

01:53.083 --> 01:53.916
I got in.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.333
-You got in?
-Dawn!

01:55.416 --> 01:56.250
I got in!

01:56.333 --> 01:58.416
Oh, Dawn, your mother would be so proud!

01:58.500 --> 02:01.916
-This was her dream for you!
-You're going to school in Paris!

02:02.000 --> 02:04.666
Oh my God! Wait, let me see!

02:04.750 --> 02:07.625
Wait, what's this part about
no available student housing?

02:08.541 --> 02:12.791
Uh, it says, "Your request
for financial aid has been declined."

02:13.375 --> 02:18.750
"The estimated tuition and living costs
are… 30,000 a year."

02:18.833 --> 02:21.000
Is your Paris fund going to cover that?

02:21.083 --> 02:23.750
We can talk details later.

02:23.833 --> 02:26.666
I'm gonna be late for work.
Birdie, I'm gonna pick up your meds.

02:26.750 --> 02:29.375
Max, don't forget to bring
your sheet music home from choir.

02:29.458 --> 02:30.833
-Yeah.
-I'm out of here.

02:30.916 --> 02:33.416
Whoa! You hardly ate anything.

02:34.041 --> 02:35.625
Thanks, Birdie. Bye, guys!

02:35.708 --> 02:38.083
Stay off your phone. Eat your breakfast.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.791
You scared the hell out of me.

02:55.875 --> 02:59.208
Sorry. I saw your face back there.
What's wrong?

03:00.083 --> 03:01.125
I don't have the money.

03:02.125 --> 03:03.750
What? You've been saving for years.

03:03.833 --> 03:07.333
Insurance didn't cover everything
for Birdie's fall last year.

03:07.416 --> 03:10.875
Wait, you used your Paris funds for that?
How much do you have?

03:11.750 --> 03:13.791
Enough for the first year's tuition.

03:14.916 --> 03:18.708
After that, I can't cover a plane ticket,
much less housing.

03:18.791 --> 03:20.291
Don't tell Birdie yet.

03:21.250 --> 03:25.416
Okay. But this is what you and Mom
always dreamt of. There's got to be a way.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.416
I'll figure it out.

03:30.458 --> 03:33.625
Hey, can I hitch a ride into town?
I need to stop by Piggly Wiggly.

03:33.708 --> 03:34.541
Get in.

03:36.583 --> 03:37.541
Thank you.

03:40.250 --> 03:41.250
Order's up!

03:43.416 --> 03:44.250
Thanks.

03:45.583 --> 03:47.208
-Here you go, Buck.
-Mm.

03:54.041 --> 03:57.125
Hey, Dawn, you ever going
to give me another shot?

03:57.208 --> 04:00.666
Levi, it's been two years. Let it go.

04:01.375 --> 04:05.833
Plus, I know for a fact that you've been
dating Tammy from the DQ.

04:06.833 --> 04:09.083
-Where'd you hear that?
-Everywhere.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.250
Guess I'm worth talking about, then.

04:13.541 --> 04:14.541
Ew.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.500
Dawn, I know how you're getting to Paris.

04:19.750 --> 04:23.375
The Honey Pot is heading to Paris
and we want you.

04:23.458 --> 04:25.583
You want me to audition for The Honey Pot?

04:25.666 --> 04:26.625
Yep.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.125
Like some cream with your crazy?

04:29.208 --> 04:31.666
Come on!
Auditions are this Saturday in Dallas.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.375
If they pick you,
there's a $20,000 appearance fee.

04:34.958 --> 04:36.666
And the only reason I know that

04:36.750 --> 04:39.083
is 'cause last year's runner-up
used it to get butt implants.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.333
More coffee?

04:43.458 --> 04:45.958
But listen, you don't even
have to do the entire show.

04:46.041 --> 04:49.708
Once you're eliminated, you're already
gonna be in Paris with a big fat check.

04:49.791 --> 04:53.666
I don't even watch The Honey Pot.
They'd see right through me.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.958
That's not a problem. I'll coach you.

04:57.125 --> 05:00.958
Dawn, you know that the Academie d'Art
can jumpstart your career.

05:01.041 --> 05:03.708
You should have let me help you
with Birdie last year.

05:04.583 --> 05:06.083
Let me help you get to Paris.

05:10.166 --> 05:11.875
-All right.
-Really?

05:11.958 --> 05:13.791
But I'm not getting butt implants.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.208
Each season, The Honey Pot
features a rich single hottie,

05:17.291 --> 05:19.875
and it always takes place
on the bachelor's swanky estate,

05:19.958 --> 05:21.875
where he starts
picking them off one by one

05:21.958 --> 05:25.458
until he finds his one true love
in a very intense season finale

05:25.541 --> 05:29.833
because that is when she decides
if she wants him or the money.

05:29.916 --> 05:32.166
-How much money?
-Quarter of a million dollars.

05:32.250 --> 05:35.041
Who would ever pick the guy?

05:35.625 --> 05:37.333
Oh, almost all of them.

05:37.416 --> 05:39.416
Because they're trapped
in the love vortex.

05:40.291 --> 05:42.458
What is a love vortex?

05:42.541 --> 05:45.000
Well, imagine a world
with only one man in it…

05:45.083 --> 05:46.875
-Pretty lean.
-…and 20 women.

05:46.958 --> 05:47.791
Getting worse.

05:47.875 --> 05:52.833
Every activity is designed to trigger
that primal quest for love and mating.

05:54.916 --> 05:57.708
Okay, so I've broken down
the contestant's typical behavior.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.791
To make sure
you get kicked off right away,

05:59.875 --> 06:01.333
-you do the opposite.
-Got it.

06:01.416 --> 06:05.583
So they always flip their hair
and they look longingly into his eyes,

06:05.666 --> 06:07.416
so you cannot lock eyes with him.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.250
And it's a really big deal
who gets to kiss him first,

06:10.333 --> 06:11.833
so make sure that it's not you.

06:11.916 --> 06:16.625
Right. So no flippin',
no lookin', no longin', no kissin'.

06:16.708 --> 06:20.791
Yes. And then I have no idea why,
but no one ever eats on these shows.

06:20.875 --> 06:22.875
So just feel free to stuff your face.

06:22.958 --> 06:24.208
This is crazy.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.583
I never should have told you
that I drained my Paris fund.

06:27.666 --> 06:29.791
You spent your Paris fund?

06:30.750 --> 06:32.083
For what?

06:32.166 --> 06:37.333
Dawn paid for some of your bills
after the accident last year.

06:37.416 --> 06:38.666
I didn't want you to worry.

06:38.750 --> 06:41.916
Dawn Francis,
that was not your decision to make.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.250
Uh-oh, she put middle name.

06:43.333 --> 06:46.916
This is so like you, trying to control
every situation but your own.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.541
-No, it's not.
-Yes, it is.

06:49.625 --> 06:52.833
I watch you working
in the barn year after year,

06:52.916 --> 06:55.625
but you never put out
any of your pieces, did you?

06:56.375 --> 06:58.708
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is.

06:58.791 --> 07:02.166
And now you are spending your savings
to cover something

07:02.250 --> 07:04.625
that you and I could have
worked out together.

07:05.541 --> 07:06.375
Piffle!

07:07.541 --> 07:08.625
You're scared.

07:12.208 --> 07:13.041
No, I'm not.

07:13.125 --> 07:16.916
You know what's the scariest thing
that you have to face?

07:18.458 --> 07:20.125
-An angry grandmother?
-Mm.

07:20.208 --> 07:21.541
Opportunity.

07:23.166 --> 07:27.125
It's okay to be scared, honey.
But it's not okay to hide.

07:27.208 --> 07:28.250
Because you're good.

07:29.375 --> 07:31.291
And I suspect you might be great.

07:32.291 --> 07:36.458
But you've got to commit yourself
in order to find out.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.291
All right.

07:40.666 --> 07:43.083
Toss me into the vortex and sign me up.

07:44.708 --> 07:47.916
So, what kind of girls
audition for these shows?

07:48.000 --> 07:51.333
Oh, well, you've got all types of girls.
You have the Cinderella type.

07:51.833 --> 07:54.791
I have been dreaming my whole life
of finding my prince.

07:54.875 --> 07:58.875
I am done kissing frogs.
They eat them in France, you know.

07:58.958 --> 08:02.125
You've got the rough
around the edges type.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.583
I'm a biker chick.
I'm out here looking for my ride or die.

08:06.666 --> 08:10.250
But on the low-low,
I just want someone to get freaky with.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.208
The one with baby fever.

08:13.291 --> 08:14.625
Whoo!

08:14.708 --> 08:16.750
Sorry, I get hot when I'm ovulating.

08:18.416 --> 08:19.625
It's happening now.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.958
They lean into the stereotypes. Yeah.

08:24.041 --> 08:25.125
What type am I?

08:25.208 --> 08:26.708
You're the small-town girl type.

08:26.791 --> 08:27.916
-No.
-Yes.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.458
Oh, small-town girl type?

08:30.541 --> 08:31.875
Without a doubt.

08:45.041 --> 08:46.791
And camera is rolling.

08:47.958 --> 08:51.416
Okay, so I see here
that, uh, you're from a small town?

08:51.500 --> 08:53.625
Yep. 4,026.

08:53.708 --> 08:55.666
Oh, wow. So everyone's your cousin, huh?

08:57.208 --> 09:01.333
Is that why you want to be on the show?
Maybe a larger pool of men to choose from?

09:01.416 --> 09:03.333
Oh, totally.

09:03.416 --> 09:06.875
Also, I have been watching The Honey Pot

09:06.958 --> 09:09.000
-since the first season…
-Ah.

09:09.083 --> 09:11.458
-…when Annika…
-Which one was Annika?

09:11.541 --> 09:14.000
…fell in love with

09:14.083 --> 09:16.041
the blind pilot.

09:17.541 --> 09:18.750
From 'Nam.

09:18.833 --> 09:23.708
Oh, you mean Danika.
And that was the bush pilot from Nome.

09:24.708 --> 09:25.625
Alaska.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.291
You don't know anything about the show.

09:29.375 --> 09:31.875
I kind of watch it. I've seen a few eps.

09:31.958 --> 09:32.958
Are those crib notes?

09:33.041 --> 09:33.875
What? Where?

09:33.958 --> 09:34.791
On your hand.

09:37.291 --> 09:38.833
Shit.

09:38.916 --> 09:41.583
Get security!
How did she get in here? This is crazy!

09:42.666 --> 09:43.750
I'm messing with you.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.625
You do not need to know
that much about the show.

09:46.708 --> 09:49.958
Tell me about Dawn Blanton.

09:51.375 --> 09:52.958
I'm an artist.

09:53.041 --> 09:55.250
Or at least, I really want to be.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.916
So it's not your day job?

09:57.000 --> 09:58.833
No. I'm a waitress.

09:58.916 --> 10:03.250
I serve coffee and pie to people
I've known my whole life.

10:03.333 --> 10:07.083
Dawn, what do you know about Paris?

10:07.166 --> 10:13.375
Only that it's filled with
light and art and…

10:14.958 --> 10:17.375
that it's the most beautiful city
in the world.

10:18.125 --> 10:19.041
It is.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.916
So you're not currently in a relationship?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.083
-No.
-Okay.

10:23.166 --> 10:26.125
And if I can just be totally honest,

10:26.208 --> 10:29.583
I just really don't want
to get stuck where I grew up.

10:30.416 --> 10:32.583
I get it.

10:35.625 --> 10:39.458
Dawn, this was really lovely.
Thank you so much for coming in.

10:39.541 --> 10:42.375
Okay. Um, yeah,
it was really nice meeting you.

10:42.458 --> 10:44.958
-No, it was such a pleasure.
-Yeah. We'll be in touch.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.208
-What was that?
-What?

10:52.625 --> 10:54.208
-We can hear you.
-And?

10:54.291 --> 10:55.416
And I liked her.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.166
-You know what I would like?
-Mm.

10:57.250 --> 10:59.208
Contestants with
big social media followings

10:59.291 --> 11:01.166
to help us boost our tanking viewership.

11:01.250 --> 11:03.250
Well, you should have thought about that

11:03.333 --> 11:06.416
before you had the genius idea
to get rid of our host for the season.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.041
Did you forget that I'm your boss?

11:08.125 --> 11:11.291
Did you forget to tell the network
I came up with the Paris twist?

11:11.375 --> 11:13.333
-No, I'll… I'll tell them.
-When?

11:14.875 --> 11:18.083
-I'll tell them, okay? What do you want?
-I want you to say yes to Dawn.

11:18.166 --> 11:19.291
No.

11:20.166 --> 11:23.291
Huge numbers. Social media following.

11:23.375 --> 11:25.875
Thank y'all for following along
all the way from Nashville.

11:25.958 --> 11:27.291
I made it to Dallas.

11:27.375 --> 11:31.333
I'm at The Honey Pot casting office.
Let's look at all the girls.

11:31.416 --> 11:33.833
-They look so gorgeous!
-Nailed it.

11:33.916 --> 11:36.166
-Really?
-No.

11:36.250 --> 11:40.291
This is it. I am here in line
with The Honey Pot Hive. Say hi, girls.

11:40.375 --> 11:42.708
Hi!

11:42.791 --> 11:43.625
Who is that?

11:43.708 --> 11:44.833
That's Lexie Miller.

11:44.916 --> 11:47.958
She's been documenting her road trip
from Nashville to the audition,

11:48.041 --> 11:50.166
and she has a zillion followers.

11:50.250 --> 11:55.083
600 miles, 10 hours,
and 15 Diet Magenta Mules with adaptogens

11:55.166 --> 11:57.458
to keep me wired and worry line-free.

11:57.541 --> 11:59.541
Mm-hm.

11:59.625 --> 12:04.458
I just wanted to say that I'm a huge fan
of your contouring technique.

12:04.541 --> 12:06.916
I actually used it on my sister today.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.333
-You did?
-Mm-hm.

12:08.416 --> 12:10.916
Not bad. Are those your brows?

12:12.041 --> 12:14.375
Who else's would they be?

12:14.458 --> 12:17.208
I can tell you're not my base.

12:17.291 --> 12:19.166
Would you mind just scooching aside

12:19.250 --> 12:21.458
so I can knock this out
before they call me up?

12:21.541 --> 12:22.708
Thank you.

12:23.458 --> 12:25.333
Hey, Lexie. We're ready for you.

12:25.416 --> 12:28.958
Oh, wish me luck.
Or as they say in France, merde.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.625
-Hi!
-Hi! Love the dress.

12:31.708 --> 12:32.625
Thank you.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.541
Got a good girl from the country!

12:34.625 --> 12:36.500
And she got her head on straight!

12:37.166 --> 12:39.375
She don't need none of my money!

12:39.458 --> 12:41.041
Baby got a 401k!

12:41.666 --> 12:42.666
Lot of good traits

12:42.750 --> 12:44.625
It don't matter any way you slice it

12:44.708 --> 12:48.750
But the fact she got cake is the icing

12:50.125 --> 12:51.125
Icing!

12:54.625 --> 12:55.958
You're killing me!

12:56.041 --> 12:57.708
Stop whining. Enjoy the music.

12:57.791 --> 12:59.708
Eight ball, center pocket.

12:59.791 --> 13:02.250
Yeah, you're gonna miss this.

13:09.958 --> 13:11.416
Okay, you suck.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.750
-No, you do. Pony up.
-Whatever.

13:14.791 --> 13:16.541
I'm gonna go close out our tab.

13:23.416 --> 13:24.500
Nice shot.

13:25.458 --> 13:27.750
-I like your silver spurs, by the way.
-Thanks.

13:28.666 --> 13:29.541
I made them.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.166
Really? Well, that is very cool.

13:33.041 --> 13:34.458
-For one Lone Star.
-Thank you.

13:34.541 --> 13:36.166
You visiting from Dallas?

13:37.083 --> 13:38.458
Now, what makes you say that?

13:40.416 --> 13:42.291
-Custom boots without a speck of dirt.
-Uh-huh.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.166
-Fancy hat.
-Right.

13:44.250 --> 13:47.250
I'm guessing lawyer
in town for the weekend,

13:47.333 --> 13:49.250
checking out a hunting lease for the fall.

13:50.250 --> 13:52.041
-Try again.
-Venture capitalist?

13:52.125 --> 13:53.125
-Boring.
-Tech bro.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.625
Wow, you're just being rude now,
aren't you?

13:56.791 --> 13:57.666
All right.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.958
Maybe I'm just from down the road.
How about that?

14:01.041 --> 14:03.541
Can't be true.
We'd have gone to kindergarten together.

14:03.625 --> 14:07.416
Really? Did you come stomping into class
wearing those silver spurs back then?

14:07.500 --> 14:12.041
See? If you were local, you'd know
spurs aren't allowed until second grade.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.000
You got me.

14:21.708 --> 14:22.875
Hey, you care to dance?

14:22.958 --> 14:25.166
I can do some things You never thought of

14:25.250 --> 14:26.458
-Okay.
-All right.

14:26.541 --> 14:27.916
Show 'em how it's done.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.458
Better than Chevrolet

14:32.333 --> 14:34.791
Give me the time and place

14:35.541 --> 14:39.041
I can drop a buck
From across the holler

14:39.125 --> 14:41.666
You know I ain't talking dollars

14:41.750 --> 14:43.833
From half a mile away

14:45.375 --> 14:47.875
Not bad for a real estate tycoon.

14:47.958 --> 14:50.041
Not too bad for a pool shark.

14:50.125 --> 14:53.541
So now that we've established
I'm a genius millionaire, what do you do?

14:53.625 --> 14:55.750
Oh, I run a non-profit.

14:55.833 --> 14:58.208
Oh, very good. Which one?

14:58.291 --> 14:59.125
My life.

15:00.875 --> 15:03.416
Sounds like I'm gonna need
to buy you a drink after this.

15:03.500 --> 15:08.625
Oh, I'm tempted, but we were about
to head out. I have an early morning.

15:08.708 --> 15:09.541
Really?

15:11.166 --> 15:13.333
What do you got to do?
Make more free spurs?

15:13.416 --> 15:16.916
Also, a grandma
who needs a ride to Bible study.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.625
Oh, well, I… …can't argue with that.

15:19.708 --> 15:22.458
…you

15:23.875 --> 15:28.583
And what good is
Doing everything I've ever done

15:28.666 --> 15:33.000
If I never did what I promised to

15:33.083 --> 15:35.375
I like that top. It's sexy.

15:35.958 --> 15:38.041
Hey, watch your hands.

15:38.125 --> 15:40.583
-I'm not kidding.
-I'm just having a--

15:40.666 --> 15:42.250
No, stop it. Stop.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.458
-I'm sorry. I got to go.
-Wait. Hold… Hold…

15:44.541 --> 15:46.125
-Damn.
-You okay, Em?

15:46.208 --> 15:47.250
-Yeah.
-Woo-wee!

15:48.083 --> 15:49.916
-She's working them boots.
-Yeah, she is.

15:50.708 --> 15:52.625
Bet you give one hell of a ride in those.

15:52.708 --> 15:57.041
I do. But I find the steel toe and a kick
often get the job done better.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.458
Oh, she's feisty, huh?

15:59.541 --> 16:00.791
-Ready, Em?
-That's okay.

16:00.875 --> 16:03.333
We can find small-town trash anywhere.

16:03.416 --> 16:05.416
We could do better at Twin Peaks.

16:08.541 --> 16:10.708
Oh my God.

16:14.125 --> 16:14.958
Oh, shit.

16:18.666 --> 16:21.208
-Who raised you? Apologize.
-Hey.

16:21.291 --> 16:23.291
-Relax, dickhead. Shut up.
-I don't like that guy.

16:23.375 --> 16:25.291
What makes you think
you can behave like that?

16:25.375 --> 16:26.333
You don't know me.

16:26.416 --> 16:29.166
Oh, I know your type. Spoiled, unkind.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Apologize.

16:31.583 --> 16:34.000
Okay, I'm sorry.

16:38.250 --> 16:42.333
I'm sorry that tomorrow
I'll still be spoiled

16:42.416 --> 16:45.625
and you'll still be a loser
in nowheresville--

16:49.666 --> 16:50.583
Let's go home.

16:51.791 --> 16:52.708
That's good.

16:54.333 --> 16:57.916
-What happened to being my wingman?
-He's jacked. What do you want me to do?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.666
Is that cowboy still looking?

17:02.541 --> 17:05.625
Yep. Only because you got
toilet paper on your shoe, though.

17:07.208 --> 17:08.833
Little devil.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.666
-Hello. Is this Dawn Blanton?
-Yeah, this is Dawn.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.708
-I'm calling from The Honey Pot.
-Uh-huh.

17:37.125 --> 17:38.125
Oh.

17:38.833 --> 17:41.250
Okay. Thank you.

17:47.250 --> 17:48.875
You used to stand on a stool--

17:48.958 --> 17:51.166
I'm going to Paris!

18:09.583 --> 18:11.625
I made you cookies for the plane.

18:14.125 --> 18:17.208
-Don't forget your checkup on Friday.
-Oh, don't worry.

18:18.666 --> 18:20.833
You just go live your dream, honey.

18:21.416 --> 18:22.583
I love you.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.208
I love you, Birdie.

18:32.750 --> 18:34.166
Bon voyage.

18:34.250 --> 18:35.625
-Bye.
-Bye.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.583
Here. I'll take that. Thank you.

19:02.750 --> 19:03.750
I will.

19:04.750 --> 19:09.458
Give me a pose. Big smiles,
everyone's excited, we're going to Paree.

19:10.708 --> 19:12.583
Why, Rachel?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.375
I got this.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.083
Nope.

19:17.166 --> 19:22.916
Hair and makeup, please! Hey, Dawn.
How you doing? You look like you do.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.541
All right, if we could just
get more eyes, more cheeks,

19:25.625 --> 19:27.583
just overall, the whole face, uh-huh.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.583
Did you sign that contract?

19:30.666 --> 19:36.416
Oh. Yeah. Are y'all making
a reality show or sending us to space?

19:36.500 --> 19:38.750
-You printed out the whole thing.
-Mm-hm.

19:38.833 --> 19:39.958
Whoo!

19:40.458 --> 19:43.083
-It's cold.
-That looks great. Perfection.

19:43.166 --> 19:45.166
All right, Dawn,
if you want to walk with me.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.166
Guys, let's set up for The Honey Pot shot.

20:09.750 --> 20:13.833
This is your captain speaking.
You are now free to move about the cabin.

20:16.750 --> 20:19.250
All right, ladies,
I'm going to need your cell phones.

20:19.333 --> 20:22.833
You will get them back once you've
been eliminated. Thank you so much.

20:22.916 --> 20:25.375
I think you mean if we're eliminated.

20:29.625 --> 20:31.750
Champagne, mademoiselle?

20:31.833 --> 20:33.458
Oui!

20:34.291 --> 20:38.083
Hey, Red, I'll have a Wild Turkey.
Make that a double.

20:38.166 --> 20:39.833
-What are those?
-Hydrating gloves.

20:40.708 --> 20:42.875
No, thank you. I'm moisturizing.

20:42.958 --> 20:45.750
I can't. I might be
getting pregnant this week.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.125
Oh. Want to try one?

20:50.208 --> 20:52.875
Mm-mm. I'm wearing four layers of Spanx.

20:52.958 --> 20:54.750
The only thing
fitting in here is an Altoid,

20:54.833 --> 20:56.833
maybe a thimble of diet soda.

20:56.916 --> 20:58.666
Let me know if you change your mind

20:58.750 --> 21:00.333
-or need a medic.
-Mm.

21:00.416 --> 21:01.916
-I'll take a cookie.
-Oh, yeah.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.958
Mm. I'm Jasmine.

21:05.541 --> 21:06.541
I'm Dawn.

21:06.625 --> 21:07.541
Macaron?

21:07.625 --> 21:08.958
Oh… Uh…

21:09.041 --> 21:11.000
Just put it in my mouth.

21:11.083 --> 21:13.250
But not the whole thing. Half.

21:13.333 --> 21:14.916
No, a quarter.

21:17.291 --> 21:18.208
Mmm.

21:18.291 --> 21:19.583
Nice, uh… nice tiara.

21:19.666 --> 21:22.625
Thanks. It's my proudest accomplishment.

21:22.708 --> 21:26.333
Oh, no shit. Mine's banging
Taylor Swift's road manager.

21:26.416 --> 21:28.083
Oh. Oh, wow.

21:28.166 --> 21:31.708
Gosh, I hope our bachelor's a prince.
He's a prince, right?

21:31.791 --> 21:35.625
I bet he lives in a palace
like the Louv-rah.

21:35.708 --> 21:37.250
With the Mona Lisa?

21:37.833 --> 21:39.000
Wait, who's Lisa?

21:39.083 --> 21:41.833
-Dawn, what about you?
-Oh, um…

21:41.916 --> 21:46.500
Yeah, I'm just, I'm really excited to see
what's waiting for me in Paris.

21:46.583 --> 21:47.625
Mm-hm.

21:47.708 --> 21:50.750
Oh, and, uh… super ready

21:50.833 --> 21:53.416
to meet, uh… a hot…

21:53.500 --> 21:57.250
No, a super steamy… French guy.

21:58.833 --> 22:00.500
Amateur.

22:01.583 --> 22:03.208
To a hot French man.

22:03.291 --> 22:04.666
-Cheers to that.
-Cheers.

22:04.750 --> 22:07.416
-Cheers.
-To Paris!

22:16.666 --> 22:19.958
We are making our final descent.
Please prepare for landing.

22:23.625 --> 22:26.208
-We're still flying.
-Why can't we see out?

22:26.291 --> 22:29.125
They're dimmable windows
using electrochromosome gel.

22:29.208 --> 22:31.416
The show has them locked in night mode.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.375
They want our spontaneous reactions
when we step off the plane.

22:34.458 --> 22:38.291
Bummer. I really wanted
to see the city from up here.

22:43.666 --> 22:46.708
Hey, garçon, you mind getting
your baguette out of my face?

22:46.791 --> 22:49.625
-Sorry.
-Ladies, I know it's been a long flight,

22:49.708 --> 22:51.583
but please, let's look alive.

22:51.666 --> 22:54.750
We are finally arriving in Paree!

22:57.250 --> 23:00.166
All right.

23:11.916 --> 23:14.250
All right, everybody,
we're in position. Stand by.

23:22.875 --> 23:24.958
Oh my God.

23:30.333 --> 23:32.541
Oh, hell no.

23:34.333 --> 23:35.500
What the f…

23:39.291 --> 23:41.583
Kiss my grits.

23:41.666 --> 23:45.166
Wait. Is there a Texas in France?

23:45.250 --> 23:47.041
Hey!

23:48.333 --> 23:52.000
Can you please
move along? You're causing a blockage.

23:52.083 --> 23:54.541
What the hell happened to your accent?

23:55.750 --> 23:58.375
Okay, I can pivot.

23:58.458 --> 24:02.250
Let's just get you right here. Um, Dawn,
why don't you tell us how you feel?

24:02.333 --> 24:06.791
I feel like I'm less than an hour
from my hometown.

24:08.625 --> 24:10.458
We're in Paris, Texas.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.666
Have we just been up there
circling for nine hours?

24:13.750 --> 24:17.208
Okay, you're not wrong.
Uh, that was not very green of us.

24:17.291 --> 24:19.875
Yeah, we promoted
a dating show set in Paris,

24:19.958 --> 24:22.500
and, well, here we are.
Never said Paris, France.

24:22.583 --> 24:27.458
I want my stuff. I want my phone.
And I want the hell out of here.

24:27.541 --> 24:29.791
All right, hey, let's all just calm down.

24:29.875 --> 24:32.333
Why don't you stay
and give this experience a shot?

24:32.416 --> 24:33.958
And you signed a contract.

24:34.041 --> 24:37.875
You got to shoot me
and all of these girls looking like fools.

24:37.958 --> 24:39.666
-I'm going home.
-Oh…

24:39.750 --> 24:43.166
You're obligated to stay on the show
until you're cut by our leading man.

24:43.250 --> 24:45.875
Otherwise, you forfeit
your appearance fee.

24:48.375 --> 24:50.416
-Suck it up, buttercup.
-Hey.

24:53.291 --> 24:56.291
-So you'll do it?
-Cameras are rolling. Energy.

25:00.166 --> 25:04.458
Sitting at the airport
I've got my bag at hand

25:04.541 --> 25:06.833
I'm finally going where I need to be

25:07.416 --> 25:11.583
Because I'm going down to Paris

25:11.666 --> 25:14.666
And just as fast as I can

25:17.833 --> 25:20.166
Viva Paree!

25:22.541 --> 25:24.000
What do I think of cowboys?

25:24.083 --> 25:25.791
-One word?
-Giddy up.

25:25.875 --> 25:27.083
I'm being kidnapped.

25:27.166 --> 25:28.541
There's somebody waiting for me

25:28.625 --> 25:32.375
I'm a Paris, Texas man

25:35.750 --> 25:38.250
Paris, Texas man

25:38.333 --> 25:40.541
My God, you see that?

25:48.458 --> 25:49.500
Hello, ladies.

25:49.583 --> 25:51.500
Hi!

25:51.583 --> 25:53.958
Welcome to Silver Spur Ranch.

25:54.041 --> 25:57.583
This will be your home
for the duration of your time on the show.

25:59.250 --> 26:01.500
Tomorrow at noon, there will be a picnic

26:01.583 --> 26:07.583
where you will finally get to meet
your leading man, Mr. Trey McAllen III.

26:12.041 --> 26:16.000
But for now, let us get you settled
into your bunkhouses. Follow me.

26:19.333 --> 26:23.666
'Cause I can drive your truck
Faster than you can

26:25.208 --> 26:27.666
Oh my God!

26:27.750 --> 26:32.291
I can dance with the ladies
Drink with the fellers

26:32.375 --> 26:36.791
You know Fridays are good
But boy, with me they’d be better

26:36.875 --> 26:41.083
Country boys sure know how to have fun

26:41.166 --> 26:45.000
But let me show you how
A country girl gets it done, y'all

26:45.083 --> 26:46.250
Keep up

26:47.416 --> 26:48.916
Oh my God!

26:49.000 --> 26:51.958
Come on in, ladies. Come on in.

26:53.875 --> 26:55.875
I take it you like your new digs, yeah?

26:55.958 --> 26:57.250
Yes!

26:58.583 --> 27:00.916
All right, well,
we know you packed for Europe,

27:01.000 --> 27:02.875
so we have gone ahead and provided

27:02.958 --> 27:07.875
some ranch-inspired attire for you
waiting in the swag room.

27:09.041 --> 27:10.791
What? There's a swag room?

27:20.875 --> 27:23.083
Oh, Dawn, you don't want
to go check it out?

27:23.166 --> 27:24.416
Can I just go to my room?

27:25.250 --> 27:26.750
Sure. It's that way.

27:29.791 --> 27:31.791
Girl! That's mine!

27:31.875 --> 27:35.291
-I like this 'cause it's slutty chic.
-I don't have any more hands.

27:35.375 --> 27:37.333
There are enough clothes for everyone!

27:38.166 --> 27:39.458
You all stop fighting!

27:39.541 --> 27:41.250
Works every time.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.541
-Wow.
-That was so insane.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.416
Wait a minute, that's my hat!

27:54.791 --> 27:57.041
It's like a mosh pit out there

27:57.125 --> 28:00.583
with sequins and hair extensions
flying everywhere, hm?

28:01.958 --> 28:03.500
So we're roomies.

28:05.416 --> 28:08.333
Wow, Paris, Texas. That was a shock.

28:08.416 --> 28:11.416
But I'm from Chicago, so this is
still a whole new country for me.

28:11.500 --> 28:15.333
Well, I was born about 60 miles down
the road and lived there my whole life.

28:15.416 --> 28:17.250
Oh, so you've got this wired.

28:18.750 --> 28:20.916
Maybe you can give me some tips.

28:21.000 --> 28:21.833
Sure.

28:24.291 --> 28:25.958
Thanks.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.500
Um, come on.

28:33.666 --> 28:34.541
Come on.

28:37.333 --> 28:38.958
Morning. Can I hold him for you?

28:39.041 --> 28:41.250
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

28:42.083 --> 28:43.416
He picked up a stone.

28:45.166 --> 28:46.833
I got it. Thanks.

28:47.791 --> 28:50.833
Sorry, I got held up dropping off
some bales back in the barn.

28:56.708 --> 28:57.666
-What?
-You!

28:58.333 --> 28:59.458
What are you doing here?

29:00.375 --> 29:02.916
Oh my God, are you…
Are you here for the show?

29:03.791 --> 29:06.125
-Yeah, but not on purpose.
-Huh.

29:06.208 --> 29:08.000
I thought I was going to Paris, France,

29:08.083 --> 29:10.791
not some land baron's ranch harem.

29:12.916 --> 29:15.583
-That's funny.
-Wait, are you here for the show?

29:16.375 --> 29:18.791
-Am I…
-Is this your ranch?

29:19.250 --> 29:20.208
Mm.

29:20.291 --> 29:22.416
Are you… the honey?

29:22.500 --> 29:24.166
I told you I wasn't a tech bro.

29:24.250 --> 29:25.458
You're a weekend cowboy.

29:25.541 --> 29:29.500
-Now, I wouldn't exactly call myself that.
-No. Gordito here is the real deal.

29:29.583 --> 29:31.375
-Uh-huh.
-Gordito?

29:31.458 --> 29:34.833
Well, I may have been a chubby child.

29:34.916 --> 29:36.041
-Aw.
-Miss.

29:36.125 --> 29:37.166
Yeah, bud.

29:38.416 --> 29:40.583
Trey McAllen. Nice to meet you.

29:40.666 --> 29:44.375
Dawn Blanton. Kick me off this ranch.

29:44.458 --> 29:46.833
-Oh, well, you just got here.
-Dawn?

29:47.500 --> 29:50.166
-What if I don't wanna kick you off?
-This isn't what I signed up for.

29:50.250 --> 29:52.125
You're going to like it more than France.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.583
-I'm afraid of horses.
-You were handling Duke fine.

29:54.666 --> 29:56.541
-Manure makes me nauseous.
-Don't stand downwind.

29:56.625 --> 29:57.625
I'm into girls.

29:57.708 --> 30:00.083
Of course you are.
There's a harem waiting for you.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.416
Hey, Dawn, we need you in hair and makeup.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.833
-Hair and makeup.
-That's not happening.

30:04.916 --> 30:06.166
No, of course not.

30:07.416 --> 30:09.916
You know what to do.
It was nice meeting you.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.041
Miss.

30:15.333 --> 30:18.916
Oh my God, where is this child?
I am not a babysitter.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.791
Oh! Hey, Dawn.

30:21.875 --> 30:24.875
Thanks for joining our party.
Why are you not getting dressed?

30:24.958 --> 30:27.916
Guess this guy will have to love me
as I am or send me home.

30:29.375 --> 30:34.833
Dawn, look, I know that you were
really disappointed by the Paris thing,

30:34.916 --> 30:37.791
but I don't think
you're going to be disappointed by Trey.

30:39.333 --> 30:41.333
I didn't come on the show to find a honey.

30:42.083 --> 30:43.083
You say what now?

30:43.666 --> 30:44.583
I lied.

30:44.666 --> 30:48.375
Look, I'm not proud of it,
but I needed the plane ticket

30:48.458 --> 30:51.375
and the appearance fee
to go to Paris to start school.

30:51.458 --> 30:54.708
And if he kicks me off soon,
I could still make it there.

30:54.791 --> 30:57.708
I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
I want to get in and out.

30:57.791 --> 30:58.625
Hey, listen.

31:00.250 --> 31:03.208
First, please do not share
that information with anybody else.

31:03.291 --> 31:07.000
And secondly, girl,
that's more than lying. It could be fraud.

31:07.083 --> 31:10.583
And if it is, you can kiss
your little appearance fee goodbye.

31:10.666 --> 31:12.916
The network could sue you.
What were you thinking?

31:13.000 --> 31:16.083
But this whole show
is about choosing love or money.

31:16.166 --> 31:18.583
Plenty of girls are here
for fame and cash, not love.

31:18.666 --> 31:21.458
Yes, but they decided
to play the game, Dawn. Okay?

31:21.541 --> 31:25.000
Not cheat the system for a plane ticket
to Europe. That is the difference.

31:26.958 --> 31:31.291
Damn it, Dawn. I like you.
Hell, I'm even rooting for you.

31:31.791 --> 31:35.250
So if you want to get out of here safely,
do it the old-fashioned way.

31:35.333 --> 31:38.041
Get dumped in front of millions
of people watching around the world.

31:38.125 --> 31:40.916
Mmm-kay? Got it?
Glad we had this little chat.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.541
Now, I need you to go get dressed.

31:42.625 --> 31:44.083
Hello again, ladies.

31:44.166 --> 31:45.708
Hi!

31:45.791 --> 31:48.208
Well, this is your first ensemble date.

31:48.291 --> 31:51.958
There will be an elimination tonight
and ten of you will be going home.

31:52.041 --> 31:55.708
-Thank God.
-Be sure to make a great first impression.

31:56.291 --> 31:59.125
And now, prepare to meet your bachelor.

32:02.666 --> 32:04.208
What the frick was that?

32:05.208 --> 32:06.666
What was that?

32:08.166 --> 32:09.500
Oh my God!

32:31.916 --> 32:35.333
Hey, afternoon, ladies.
Welcome to Silver Spur Ranch.

32:35.416 --> 32:37.416
I'm Trey McAllen. Nice to meet you.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.125
Hi!

32:39.708 --> 32:42.250
I understand y'all had
quite the surprise coming in.

32:42.333 --> 32:45.083
-Hope y'all aren't too disappointed.
-No.

32:45.166 --> 32:47.875
My great-granddaddy
started this ranch about 100 years ago,

32:47.958 --> 32:49.791
and I am the proud owner of it today.

32:49.875 --> 32:53.875
So, it may not be Paris, France,
but it is paradise to me.

32:53.958 --> 32:55.875
Aw.

32:55.958 --> 32:59.375
Now, I'm very excited
to meet each and every one of you.

32:59.458 --> 33:01.833
So… Thank you, Jesus.
Follow me. Let's eat some grub.

33:04.375 --> 33:06.833
-How are you?
-Good, how are you?

33:10.458 --> 33:13.750
Us Southern girls
We're thick as thieves

33:13.833 --> 33:15.750
We're thick as thieves

33:15.833 --> 33:19.208
We're thick as thieves
We're thick as thieves

33:19.291 --> 33:22.000
Blessed by the cornbread
Mama's been fixin'

33:22.083 --> 33:24.375
Can we, uh,
move the platter closer to Lexie?

33:24.458 --> 33:25.375
Yeah.

33:25.458 --> 33:28.166
No, that's great, Oscar,
but now you're in the shot.

33:30.458 --> 33:32.791
Get out of the shot, numbnuts!

33:34.958 --> 33:37.833
Don't look at me. That's your nepo hire.

33:37.916 --> 33:40.875
-I'm Amber. Aloha.
-Good to meet you.

33:40.958 --> 33:43.958
Mahalo. Which island are you from?

33:44.041 --> 33:45.458
Oh, I'm from Cleveland.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.750
Oh, well, very nice lei.

33:48.833 --> 33:50.916
You have no idea.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.041
I like you. That's funny.
You, uh… You been to the islands, then?

33:55.041 --> 33:58.416
No, I haven't,
but maybe you could take me.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.750
Mmm.

34:13.791 --> 34:15.625
-What is Dawn doing?
-Eating a hot wing.

34:15.708 --> 34:17.333
But nobody eats on reality shows.

34:17.416 --> 34:19.416
You're looking like a tall glass of milk.

34:19.500 --> 34:22.083
Thank you. Farm-raised, you know.

34:22.916 --> 34:24.291
Oh, okay.

34:24.375 --> 34:26.250
-Hi.
-I'm Jasmine.

34:26.333 --> 34:27.833
-Jasmine. Oh!
-Like the scent!

34:27.916 --> 34:29.583
Smell has the strongest link to memory.

34:29.666 --> 34:32.333
I… I guess I will not
be forgetting you then, huh, Jasmine?

34:34.583 --> 34:35.541
Here.

34:45.125 --> 34:46.500
Ah. It's a little spicy.

34:46.583 --> 34:49.125
-Excuse us. Goodbye.
-Oh yeah, there you go.

34:49.208 --> 34:51.416
-Hey there, I'm Heather.
-Heather.

34:51.500 --> 34:52.583
You're a big boy.

34:52.666 --> 34:53.541
I am.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.333
Mm, calluses. How did you get these?

34:56.416 --> 34:57.875
-Well--
-Wait, don't tell me.

34:57.958 --> 34:59.208
I want to imagine it.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.041
-Hi.
-Yeah.

35:02.125 --> 35:03.666
-I'm Eve.
-Hi.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.625
-God, I love your baby blues.
-Thank you.

35:05.708 --> 35:07.083
-Speaking of babies…
-Uh-huh.

35:07.166 --> 35:10.458
…I asked the producers to mock up
a photo of what our kids would look like.

35:10.541 --> 35:12.208
Okay. Oh!

35:12.291 --> 35:14.166
He has your lips.

35:14.250 --> 35:16.333
That's terrifying. You should hide that.

35:16.416 --> 35:17.916
-Hey there, Prince Charming.
-Hi.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.250
Hi. My parents named me Cindy.

35:20.333 --> 35:23.500
-Cindy.
-But you can call me Cinderella.

35:23.583 --> 35:24.416
Hm.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.333
And I don't have to be home by midnight.

35:29.416 --> 35:31.416
-No pumpkin hour for you, noted.
-No, sir.

35:32.125 --> 35:33.125
-Well, hello.
-Hi.

35:33.208 --> 35:35.916
I'm Lexie Miller from Nashville.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.541
You know there'd be no Texas
without Tennessee, right?

35:38.625 --> 35:41.666
All those good folks
who volunteered at the Alamo and all.

35:41.750 --> 35:43.708
Davy Crockett was my hero as a kid.

35:43.791 --> 35:45.708
Oh! Mine too.

35:45.791 --> 35:48.083
Dawn. Dawn.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.916
You've got a bit of dust on your face.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.208
-Oh, uh--
-May I?

35:56.875 --> 35:57.875
Yeah. Is it…

35:59.958 --> 36:00.916
Uh…

36:01.958 --> 36:03.583
There.

36:04.333 --> 36:09.125
Why don't you keep this close
to your heart and remember the Alamo?

36:09.208 --> 36:10.666
Yes, ma'am.

36:11.583 --> 36:13.916
You do know we lost at the Alamo, right?

36:14.500 --> 36:16.625
That's a very good point.

36:16.708 --> 36:17.875
Right.

36:19.375 --> 36:20.541
Hey, Gordito.

36:22.833 --> 36:26.041
Of all the ranches in all the world,
you gotta walk into mine.

36:26.125 --> 36:28.541
And I'll walk right out of it
if you just play along.

36:28.625 --> 36:31.083
You know, you ain't gonna find
a man like me in France.

36:31.166 --> 36:32.208
That's the whole point.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.958
What is going on?

36:34.041 --> 36:36.000
Wait, hold on. This doesn't make sense.

36:36.083 --> 36:37.541
Hey!

36:37.625 --> 36:40.416
-Carl. Hold up.
-Hey.

36:40.500 --> 36:41.833
Do you two know each other?

36:41.916 --> 36:44.916
-Yeah. We met a couple weeks ago at a bar.
-We did meet before.

36:45.458 --> 36:47.916
-That disqualifies me, right?
-Absolutely.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.541
-Bye, bitch.
-Uh, okay.

36:49.625 --> 36:53.791
Not necessarily,
if it was just a casual interaction.

36:53.875 --> 36:55.791
Did you guys, uh, have sex?

36:55.875 --> 36:57.083
-No!
-No. No.

36:57.166 --> 36:59.291
Well, do you feel
stalked or threatened, Trey?

36:59.375 --> 37:01.500
What? Me, stalk him?

37:05.791 --> 37:07.750
No, I don't feel stalked. I'm good.

37:07.833 --> 37:10.625
-I'll stalk you.
-Hey, you're right there, aren't you?

37:10.708 --> 37:11.708
-Mm-hm.
-Yeah.

37:11.791 --> 37:14.375
You see that over there?

37:14.458 --> 37:15.708
Dawn wants a Frenchman.

37:15.791 --> 37:17.250
I hear they're great kissers.

37:17.333 --> 37:18.833
-Mmm.
-Mm-hm.

37:18.916 --> 37:21.583
I'm pretty good myself.

37:21.666 --> 37:23.916
She can stay.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.958
Uh, Frank, Spike, get over here. Let's get
some footage about the coincidence.

37:30.125 --> 37:32.333
All right. So, here we go.

37:32.416 --> 37:36.083
Dawn, why don't you tell us
what was going through your mind

37:36.166 --> 37:37.791
when you saw Trey today?

37:41.541 --> 37:42.541
I thought,

37:43.291 --> 37:46.458
"There's that poor guy
from the bar with the wicked rash

37:46.541 --> 37:49.000
and scorching case of halitosis."

37:49.625 --> 37:51.416
"I sure hope he marries me."

37:55.208 --> 37:56.041
Huh.

37:57.166 --> 37:58.708
We can cut that part out.

37:59.333 --> 38:02.125
Great. Uh, well, hi. I'm Trey McAllen.

38:02.208 --> 38:04.666
The ladies, interesting bunch, isn't it?

38:04.750 --> 38:05.625
Fantastic.

38:05.708 --> 38:06.833
Some of them are

38:08.083 --> 38:09.916
more… more excited than others.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.750
Oh, wow. He's just so gorgeous.

38:12.833 --> 38:14.958
Cinderella, she's lost
her slipper somewhere.

38:15.041 --> 38:16.791
I think you'll find it on the ranch.

38:16.875 --> 38:21.041
I know Trent and I just met,
but he's my soulmate.

38:21.125 --> 38:23.083
Lexie, wow. She's… she's incredible.

38:23.166 --> 38:26.708
I know Trey and I just met, but it
already feels like he's my soulmate.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.541
I know Trey and I just met…

38:29.625 --> 38:32.958
Oh, Eve, that was the one that…
She keeps sneaking up on me and saying,

38:33.041 --> 38:35.333
"I want your baby. I want your baby."

38:35.416 --> 38:37.291
But I know he's my soulmate.

38:37.375 --> 38:39.958
Whoo.

38:40.041 --> 38:42.500
Dawn, wow.
She's a little spicy thing. I like her.

38:42.583 --> 38:44.250
Nope. Not my soulmate.

38:45.166 --> 38:46.416
-Damn it, Dawn.
-What?

38:46.500 --> 38:48.625
She's playing hard to get. I'll get her.

38:53.916 --> 38:54.833
Amber.

38:56.958 --> 38:58.833
-Will you accept this spur?
-I will.

39:01.416 --> 39:02.708
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

39:04.666 --> 39:05.958
Aww.

39:06.041 --> 39:09.041
Now, ladies,
there are only two spurs left,

39:09.125 --> 39:11.625
and the next one goes to

39:12.458 --> 39:14.791
Lexie.

39:14.875 --> 39:16.083
Excuse me, ladies.

39:19.666 --> 39:21.750
-Lexie, do you accept this spur?
-Mm-hm.

39:22.333 --> 39:24.750
I thought you'd never ask.

39:31.458 --> 39:34.916
And the final spur of the night goes to…

39:45.916 --> 39:48.208
Dawn.

39:48.291 --> 39:49.541
Yes!

39:55.416 --> 39:57.458
What are you doing?
You were supposed to cut me.

39:57.541 --> 39:59.750
Frenchmen are overrated.
Let me prove it to you.

40:00.375 --> 40:01.500
Dawn.

40:02.166 --> 40:05.416
-Will you accept this spur?
-Thanks, but I brought my own.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.250
Well, I'd like you to have this one.

40:09.791 --> 40:11.041
Take it!

40:13.458 --> 40:14.750
-Great. All right.
-Yes!

40:14.833 --> 40:17.250
Ladies, it has been truly an honor,

40:17.333 --> 40:20.208
but if you do not have a spur,

40:21.500 --> 40:23.250
this is the end of the rodeo for you.

40:29.416 --> 40:31.291
There's a line, honey. Have some manners.

40:40.083 --> 40:41.375
I cannot believe this.

40:42.166 --> 40:43.041
We made it!

40:44.750 --> 40:46.875
I know we're technically in competition,

40:47.750 --> 40:49.958
but I am so glad
that we're both still here.

40:51.166 --> 40:52.791
What do you think of Trey?

40:52.875 --> 40:55.166
I think that he's annoying as hell.

40:55.250 --> 40:57.750
-Do you need help with that?
-Yeah, please. Thanks.

40:59.083 --> 41:00.250
What do you think of him?

41:00.333 --> 41:02.416
Mm, he's handsome.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.333
Seems nice.

41:04.416 --> 41:07.125
I don't meet many males like him
in the lab where I work.

41:07.208 --> 41:10.416
-What are the males like at the lab?
-Mice, mostly.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.583
Oh.

41:12.666 --> 41:14.333
So Trey's just not your type?

41:15.333 --> 41:18.416
I wouldn't say that.
He's just not what I need right now.

41:18.500 --> 41:20.750
Hm. I sense sparks between you two.

41:21.416 --> 41:23.958
Well, I work with sparks every day,

41:24.041 --> 41:26.750
and you just have to snuff them out
before they set fire.

41:26.833 --> 41:27.791
It's easy.

41:34.708 --> 41:38.541
Come out of that lunge,
placing your hands into your heart center.

41:41.125 --> 41:43.000
Now flip that dog and go into wild thing.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.708
This is nice!

41:46.958 --> 41:48.166
Thanks, Oscar.

42:14.625 --> 42:15.500
Oh.

42:18.250 --> 42:19.166
Oh, baby.

42:21.041 --> 42:22.666
Ooh, yeah.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.416
Oh, listen to this.

42:27.083 --> 42:30.208
Smile on my, baby, you satellite

42:30.958 --> 42:34.250
Infrared you see me
Move through the night

42:42.958 --> 42:45.958
You can give me more and more
And coming up to score

42:46.041 --> 42:46.875
Yeah!

42:46.958 --> 42:50.375
You can turn me upside down
And inside out

42:50.458 --> 42:54.208
You can make me feel
The real deal, uh-huh

42:54.291 --> 42:57.750
And I can give it to you anytime
Because you're mine

42:57.833 --> 42:59.958
Sex bomb, sex bomb

43:00.041 --> 43:02.125
You're my sex bomb

43:02.208 --> 43:05.416
You can give it to me
When I need to come along

43:05.500 --> 43:07.833
Sex bomb, sex bomb

43:07.916 --> 43:09.791
You're my sex bomb

43:09.875 --> 43:13.041
And maybe you can turn me on
Turn me on

43:15.875 --> 43:16.958
Morning, Dawn.

43:18.791 --> 43:20.625
-It's gonna be a hot one.
-Morning.

43:23.833 --> 43:24.875
Damn, I'm good.

43:27.291 --> 43:29.708
Yeah, daddy.

43:31.833 --> 43:33.250
Howdy, ladies. How are we?

43:33.333 --> 43:34.250
Hi!

43:34.333 --> 43:37.666
Look like you're ready to work.
I figured we spend the day getting dirty.

43:37.750 --> 43:40.375
-How's that sound?
-You're talking my language.

43:40.458 --> 43:42.833
-Then follow me.
-Yeah!

43:43.416 --> 43:44.458
-Yeah.
-Yes, please.

43:45.125 --> 43:47.291
You don't stand a chance
dressed like that.

43:47.375 --> 43:48.500
Exactly.

43:49.583 --> 43:50.750
Girl, this is heavy.

43:50.833 --> 43:51.791
You got it, Amber.

43:51.875 --> 43:53.708
Look at you.
Teamwork making the dream work.

43:53.791 --> 43:56.166
Scooping horse shit was not on my list.

43:56.250 --> 43:58.250
No, it was so beautiful.

43:58.333 --> 44:00.083
The horses and I harmonized.

44:03.333 --> 44:04.291
Whoo!

44:05.791 --> 44:06.666
You okay?

44:06.750 --> 44:10.333
I think I'm allergic to… …hay.

44:11.875 --> 44:14.083
-If you jump, I'm jumping.
-I don't know what it was.

44:14.166 --> 44:16.208
Look at you go.
Those workouts are paying off.

44:16.291 --> 44:19.541
If you thought that was rough,
try farting in those elimination dresses.

44:20.916 --> 44:23.333
I didn't even know we had goats.

44:23.416 --> 44:26.500
-That could be your daddy. Yeah.
-Where'd you find… Oh, okay.

44:26.583 --> 44:27.958
Yeah, her clock is ticking.

44:28.041 --> 44:30.958
Today, I got one step closer
to breastfeeding.

44:32.666 --> 44:35.250
-Need a little help there, sweetheart?
-Thank you, cowboy.

44:37.125 --> 44:39.041
I'm a natural at taming stallions.

44:41.458 --> 44:45.000
-Rachel, you're standing in horse shit.
-Oh no! Who put that there?

44:50.750 --> 44:53.458
Oh! Sure you don't want
to lose that hoodie? It's hot.

44:53.541 --> 44:55.708
No, I'm fine, but you and I need to talk.

44:55.791 --> 44:58.125
-You're dying to get me alone, ain't you?
-No.

44:58.208 --> 45:00.125
I don't know how they do things in France,

45:00.208 --> 45:02.416
but I two-step with a woman
before I waltz with her.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.541
-You're two-stepping with ten women.
-Mm-hm.

45:04.625 --> 45:07.083
And no offense,
but it's clear you're overcompensating.

45:07.166 --> 45:08.333
Ladies know these things.

45:08.416 --> 45:10.416
I'll keep that in mind
next time I see one.

45:20.583 --> 45:23.000
-How's that for a two-step?
-Pretty good. Come here.

45:25.333 --> 45:28.083
-Hey.
-You are sending me home tonight.

45:28.166 --> 45:30.166
-Understand?
-What happens if I don't?

45:31.916 --> 45:34.416
Oh, come on now. Give that back. Hey.

45:34.500 --> 45:36.041
-Promise me you will.
-Do what?

45:36.625 --> 45:38.000
Stop smiling. I'm serious.

45:38.083 --> 45:40.041
So am I, and I love that hat.
Give it back.

45:40.125 --> 45:42.500
Wait. It's a really nice fit.

45:42.583 --> 45:43.875
I think I might keep it.

45:43.958 --> 45:46.416
Okay. That's my lucky hat
and I want it back.

45:46.916 --> 45:49.083
-No! No!
-Ah, okay.

45:49.166 --> 45:51.708
-You're not getting the hat! Stay back!
-Whoa!

45:54.208 --> 45:56.041
You thought I was gonna fall in.

45:56.125 --> 45:57.583
-Yeah.
-But I didn't.

45:58.458 --> 46:00.166
I have lightning-fast reflexes.

46:00.250 --> 46:01.333
Of course you do.

46:02.041 --> 46:03.166
Ah.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.291
See you at elimination.

46:13.041 --> 46:15.333
-I'm gonna kill him.
-Before or after you kiss him?

46:15.416 --> 46:16.416
What?

46:16.500 --> 46:20.083
You two are like charged particles
ready to explode.

46:20.166 --> 46:21.708
Why are you fighting it?

46:21.791 --> 46:23.250
Can you keep a secret?

46:23.333 --> 46:24.291
Yes!

46:27.333 --> 46:28.166
Okay.

46:28.750 --> 46:30.833
I got accepted into art school in France.

46:33.250 --> 46:36.083
But I need to get kicked off of this show

46:36.166 --> 46:38.291
so I can use
the appearance fee to pay for it.

46:38.375 --> 46:39.750
Oh.

46:39.833 --> 46:41.458
This all makes more sense now.

46:41.541 --> 46:45.125
But why just settle for the fee?
The date challenges start tomorrow.

46:45.208 --> 46:46.791
I don't want to win a date.

46:46.875 --> 46:51.375
You don't just win dates.
You win cash. You could rack up 20-30k.

46:52.708 --> 46:54.541
Okay. My sister left that part out.

46:54.625 --> 46:56.500
That changes everything.

46:57.333 --> 46:58.791
For me, I don't need the money.

46:58.875 --> 47:01.750
I have a patent pending
on treatment for male pattern baldness.

47:01.833 --> 47:02.875
Damn.

47:03.458 --> 47:07.000
So, wait, you came here for love?

47:07.083 --> 47:07.916
I did.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.833
And you think Trey's your guy?

47:09.916 --> 47:12.500
Mmm, I think we might be too different.

47:13.541 --> 47:15.208
I'm just excited to be here

47:15.291 --> 47:19.333
and have fun, collective interactions
within the social context.

47:19.416 --> 47:22.958
Well, all right, roomie. If I'm going to
get stuck here, let's win some dates!

47:23.041 --> 47:25.166
Yes!

47:32.250 --> 47:35.208
Ladies, step right up. Come on close.

47:35.291 --> 47:37.833
Is it you? Is it me? Who could it be?

47:38.708 --> 47:39.833
-Hi.
-How are you?

47:39.916 --> 47:43.000
Welcome to tonight's… challenge.

47:52.625 --> 47:55.583
-Yee-haw!
-Now, whoever lasts longest on the bull

47:55.666 --> 47:58.666
gets you five grand in cash
and a date with yours truly.

47:58.750 --> 48:01.083
Let's get to riding.

48:07.208 --> 48:08.750
Oh! Nice.

48:18.708 --> 48:20.125
Whoa! What's she doing?

48:26.416 --> 48:27.708
-I'm okay!
-She's alive!

48:27.791 --> 48:29.458
Whoo!

48:36.250 --> 48:37.833
And she's down!

48:40.583 --> 48:41.625
That's bullshit!

48:41.708 --> 48:43.083
Next up is Dawn.

48:43.166 --> 48:45.083
Go, Dawn! You got this!

48:47.458 --> 48:48.958
Show us what you got!

48:49.958 --> 48:51.666
Whoo-hoo!

48:51.750 --> 48:53.166
Ride it! Go on!

48:54.625 --> 48:58.125
Come on, cowgirl!
You got this! Yeah! Stay on! Stay on!

48:58.208 --> 49:00.166
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

49:02.875 --> 49:04.708
Whoa!

49:04.791 --> 49:06.875
That was so fun.

49:06.958 --> 49:09.583
And I'll tell you what,
you look good up there.

49:09.666 --> 49:11.208
I'm up, babe.

49:11.291 --> 49:12.291
Yes, ma'am.

49:13.041 --> 49:15.791
-Here we go.
-Okay.

49:15.875 --> 49:17.458
Low and slow, if you please.

49:17.541 --> 49:19.583
-"Low and slow."
-Whoo!

49:23.333 --> 49:24.791
Oh. Oh.

49:29.458 --> 49:31.958
Hey cowboy
With that look in your eyes

49:33.875 --> 49:35.500
Wow, okay, this took a turn.

49:38.583 --> 49:40.250
Am I allowed to watch this?

49:45.041 --> 49:47.833
You can keep your boots on, baby

49:48.416 --> 49:50.625
Keep your boots on, baby

49:50.708 --> 49:53.166
I'm a woman, not a lady

49:53.250 --> 49:55.333
-Whoo!
-Go, Lexie!

49:55.416 --> 49:57.458
What just happened?

49:57.541 --> 49:59.375
Looks like date night for you and me.

49:59.458 --> 50:00.791
Yes, it is. Yeah.

50:01.791 --> 50:04.291
Lexie just bullied you out of five grand

50:04.791 --> 50:06.416
and won the date.

50:06.500 --> 50:08.541
She asked for "low and slow."

50:08.625 --> 50:11.375
-Ladies first.
-Thank you. Looks like a romantic setup.

50:11.458 --> 50:12.458
Oh, they look good.

50:12.541 --> 50:15.375
It's good. It's nice we didn't need
body doubles this year.

50:18.583 --> 50:20.666
-Mm-hm.
-Let me get that champagne.

50:20.750 --> 50:24.041
Oh, look at this. Strawberries
and whipped cream. My favorite.

50:24.125 --> 50:26.500
-Watch. She's not gonna touch them.
-Make a wish.

50:26.583 --> 50:28.916
There it is.

50:29.875 --> 50:32.666
-Look at that.
-Good job, huh?

50:32.750 --> 50:33.791
Cheers.

50:33.875 --> 50:35.166
Cheers.

50:37.916 --> 50:40.208
Well, it is nice having you all to myself.

50:40.291 --> 50:41.500
-It is, isn't it?
-Mm-hm.

50:41.583 --> 50:44.166
So you are from Nashville.

50:44.250 --> 50:47.208
-Ah! Was that a coyote?
-You're a professional dancer?

50:47.291 --> 50:48.500
I just don't do coyotes.

50:48.583 --> 50:52.625
I am a very successful
content creator and brand ambassador.

50:52.708 --> 50:53.625
Do you enjoy it?

50:53.708 --> 50:57.291
Mm, I like having record high
viewer engagement. What about you?

50:57.375 --> 50:59.541
Yeah, I want to build this place

51:00.375 --> 51:02.833
into something important

51:04.000 --> 51:06.041
that lasts, that has a future.

51:06.125 --> 51:08.541
Well, as long as you've got Wi-Fi

51:08.625 --> 51:10.125
-and a helicopter pad…
-Mm.

51:10.208 --> 51:12.375
…I think I know someone
interested in the job.

51:15.166 --> 51:17.375
Who do you think that is?

51:17.458 --> 51:18.500
You're too much.

51:20.416 --> 51:21.791
-You play too much.
-Shh.

51:23.083 --> 51:24.416
What are you doing?

51:26.291 --> 51:30.375
My neck is so stiff
from that ride. It just…

51:30.958 --> 51:33.458
-He's not going to fall for that.
-Mm-mm.

51:33.541 --> 51:35.708
Uh, you want me to massage it?

51:36.291 --> 51:37.125
Would you?

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Idiot.

51:39.083 --> 51:40.916
-That'd be great.
-sure.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.208
-Hands might be cold from the champagne.
-That's all right. Get in there.

51:45.708 --> 51:48.291
-I'm taking notes. Copious.
-The screen is fogging up.

51:51.875 --> 51:53.416
Oh, Trey!

51:53.500 --> 51:55.750
That hits the spot! Oh, good Lord!

51:55.833 --> 51:58.958
Are you okay? I don't think
the bull was going that fast. You just--

51:59.041 --> 52:00.666
-Trey?
-Yeah.

52:00.750 --> 52:05.125
You and I would make a great team.
And I think you know that.

52:05.208 --> 52:08.625
But, uh, just in case you don't…

52:15.541 --> 52:16.666
Hey. Hey. Hey.

52:23.833 --> 52:24.958
What the hell was that?

52:27.041 --> 52:30.125
Oh, hey! I didn't even see you guys there.

52:30.208 --> 52:32.000
No, that's Dawn!

52:32.083 --> 52:34.500
The ground over there is slippery.

52:34.583 --> 52:37.000
-Somebody should really look into that.
-Yeah.

52:37.083 --> 52:38.250
-Okay.
-Bye.

52:40.958 --> 52:45.833
What happened?
It was the most romantic night of my life.

52:45.916 --> 52:48.250
Until Shamu showed up.

52:48.333 --> 52:52.666
I'd probably say more like
a betta fish fighting over her territory,

52:52.750 --> 52:54.250
killing other fish in the area,

52:54.333 --> 52:56.291
and surviving
in that little swamp of hers.

52:56.875 --> 52:58.833
She's like an evil stepsister.

52:58.916 --> 53:02.166
She's just doing what she needs
to do to win. I respect that.

53:03.416 --> 53:05.833
But she tries that on my date,
I'll **** that girl up.

53:05.916 --> 53:09.125
It was a really, really slippery deck.

53:15.750 --> 53:18.791
Ladies, welcome to today's challenge.

53:18.875 --> 53:23.291
All the materials you see before you
have been sourced from our organic farm.

53:23.375 --> 53:26.041
And the prize today, $10,000.

53:26.125 --> 53:27.958
-And a date with me…
-Ooh!

53:28.041 --> 53:31.208
…where we will be cooking
a farm-to-table dinner together.

53:31.291 --> 53:33.041
-Ooh!
-Yeah!

53:33.125 --> 53:37.000
So, if you've got an axe to grind,
this challenge is for you.

53:37.083 --> 53:39.166
Just remember,
closest to the bull's-eye wins.

53:39.250 --> 53:41.291
Chop-chop! Let's get to it, shall we?

53:41.375 --> 53:42.958
-Yeah.
-Chop-chop.

53:50.875 --> 53:52.541
Mm.

53:55.291 --> 53:56.750
Sorry, Cindy.

53:56.833 --> 53:58.333
Okay, you got it.

53:59.500 --> 54:00.958
-Whoo!
-Yes!

54:01.041 --> 54:03.625
-That was so good!
-I did it. Good luck.

54:03.708 --> 54:04.875
Thanks.

54:14.583 --> 54:15.791
Oh!

54:15.875 --> 54:17.791
-Ah!
-Watch this, baby.

54:20.666 --> 54:21.500
Oh!

54:21.583 --> 54:24.250
All right. I'll call the lawyers.

54:25.916 --> 54:29.500
All right, ladies. Well, since
Heather has knocked herself out,

54:29.583 --> 54:31.833
Dawn, you are the winner
of this challenge.

54:32.541 --> 54:33.375
Congrats.

54:33.458 --> 54:35.125
Let's not throw axes next season.

54:35.208 --> 54:36.166
Yeah.

54:37.208 --> 54:39.000
-Why am I talking to you?
-I don't know.

54:40.458 --> 54:43.416
Should I be concerned that you're so good
with handling sharp objects?

54:44.333 --> 54:45.666
-Maybe.
-Yeah?

54:45.750 --> 54:48.083
I use different tools on my sculptures.

54:48.666 --> 54:49.708
Uh, so you're an artist?

54:49.791 --> 54:53.541
I haven't formally trained
or anything like that.

54:53.625 --> 54:55.208
Look.

54:55.291 --> 54:57.125
If you're good, then you're good.

54:59.083 --> 55:00.500
Uh, quick question for you.

55:01.250 --> 55:02.250
What are we cooking?

55:02.333 --> 55:04.208
-Watermelon mint salad.
-Uh-huh.

55:04.291 --> 55:05.625
-Fresh corn succotash.
-Yeah.

55:05.708 --> 55:07.041
And rosemary drop biscuits.

55:07.125 --> 55:10.416
Oh my God.
Should we just get married already?

55:10.500 --> 55:12.750
All right? Carl, show's over.
Send them all home.

55:12.833 --> 55:15.000
We're getting hitched.
It's done. It's over.

55:15.083 --> 55:16.625
-Okay.
-You're doing great.

55:17.208 --> 55:18.166
-Calm down.
-Why?

55:18.250 --> 55:20.041
This is the only thing that I can make.

55:20.125 --> 55:22.500
Well, that's fine,
because the only thing I can make

55:22.583 --> 55:24.500
is a grilled cheese sandwich.

55:24.583 --> 55:26.958
But there's one thing
I can grow really well.

55:29.416 --> 55:31.250
Mm. Mm-hm.

55:32.041 --> 55:32.875
Try that.

55:39.166 --> 55:41.666
Sorry. Got a little, uh…

55:43.208 --> 55:44.041
something.

55:50.541 --> 55:52.500
-Get the biscuits. They're ready.
-Biscuits?

55:52.583 --> 55:54.208
-What about 'em?
-Get those biscuits.

55:54.291 --> 55:57.208
-God. Don't lock eyes. Don't lock eyes.
-So…

55:57.291 --> 55:58.708
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

55:58.791 --> 56:00.125
Um, where's the honey?

56:00.833 --> 56:01.833
I'm the honey.

56:02.333 --> 56:04.833
It's a bad joke. It was terrible.
Honey's in the pantry.

56:04.916 --> 56:06.958
-Of course. Thanks.
-Somewhere. Look around.

56:10.666 --> 56:11.750
Honey.

56:19.458 --> 56:22.916
This is the most delicious meal
that I've ever had. Thank you.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.291
-You're welcome.
-Mm-hm.

56:25.375 --> 56:27.250
That'll be $10,000.

56:27.333 --> 56:29.500
Oh, um, check's in the back.

56:31.291 --> 56:33.500
What was it like
growing up in a place like this?

56:35.083 --> 56:35.916
I didn't.

56:37.458 --> 56:41.458
I was only allowed to spend
my summers here. My mom wanted to travel.

56:42.333 --> 56:44.041
My dad didn't really like
the country life,

56:44.125 --> 56:46.083
so Jesus took care of the ranch,

56:46.166 --> 56:48.291
and my dad took me back to the city.

56:48.375 --> 56:49.750
So you are a city boy.

56:49.833 --> 56:51.833
No. Now, Dad is.

56:52.750 --> 56:53.583
But not me.

56:54.833 --> 56:57.125
I don't think he'll ever understand this.

56:57.708 --> 56:58.875
You wanting to be here?

56:58.958 --> 57:00.208
My need to be here.

57:03.208 --> 57:06.458
You ever feel so pulled by something
that you'd do anything to get it?

57:09.000 --> 57:09.833
I do.

57:13.041 --> 57:14.333
What is that for you?

57:20.666 --> 57:24.291
Actually, we're gonna have to continue
this at a later date. Uh, I gotta go.

57:24.375 --> 57:25.500
Uh, sorry, why is that?

57:25.583 --> 57:27.875
-There's that elimination tonight.
-Right.

57:27.958 --> 57:30.166
And I don't suppose
you're sending me packing?

57:30.250 --> 57:33.625
You still wanna go? I'm sorry,
is this about the kiss with Lexie?

57:33.708 --> 57:35.125
-Okay.
-I…

57:35.208 --> 57:37.125
Don't flatter yourself.

57:37.208 --> 57:40.291
But I cannot believe
that you fell for the whole,

57:40.375 --> 57:43.625
"My neck is so sore after that ride" act.

57:44.708 --> 57:46.958
My grandma could've ridden
that bull at that speed.

57:47.041 --> 57:49.083
Hm. Um… Um…

57:49.166 --> 57:51.916
-I promised the girls I'd bring leftovers.
-Gotcha.

57:52.000 --> 57:52.958
Well, have fun.

57:54.375 --> 57:57.041
-See you tomorrow, Dawn.
-Back up. Make a hole.

57:57.750 --> 57:59.041
Looks like I'm staying.

57:59.625 --> 58:00.625
Yeah, you are.

58:00.708 --> 58:01.750
Mm.

58:01.833 --> 58:02.916
I love it.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.041
Good morning, ladies. How y'all doing?

58:05.125 --> 58:06.125
Good morning!

58:06.208 --> 58:08.875
Welcome to Cowboy Boot Camp.

58:09.458 --> 58:13.000
Now after Eve's elimination,
it's down to you six.

58:13.083 --> 58:15.791
And we've got a very big challenge
prepared for you today,

58:15.875 --> 58:17.541
and it's worth a date with me.

58:17.625 --> 58:20.583
All right. Oh, and $15,000.

58:23.083 --> 58:25.750
To start things off,
we're gonna be hitting the tire run.

58:25.833 --> 58:28.250
Make your way over
to the hay maze and gunny sacks.

58:28.333 --> 58:31.750
Find the feed buckets,
run to the exit, walk the plank,

58:31.833 --> 58:34.500
come around and feed the pigs.
They'll love you for it.

58:34.583 --> 58:35.916
Five-second staggered start.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.125
Just to keep things interesting,
we've paired up the contestants.

58:39.208 --> 58:42.541
So, we've got Heather and Cinderella,

58:43.125 --> 58:44.708
Jasmine and Amber,

58:44.791 --> 58:47.416
and then, uh, Lexie and Dawn.

58:47.500 --> 58:48.875
It's me and you, girl.

58:49.500 --> 58:50.333
We did that.

58:50.416 --> 58:53.416
Once you make it to the plank,
it's a free-for-all.

58:53.500 --> 58:54.708
Every woman for herself.

58:55.916 --> 58:58.291
And the fastest woman to do it wins.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.583
Cowboy Boot Camp, let's go!

59:10.250 --> 59:12.125
-Damn it!
-A terrible day to have eyes.

59:12.208 --> 59:13.625
Frank, please fix this.

59:13.708 --> 59:15.291
Shit!

59:15.375 --> 59:17.791
Everybody in your positions.

59:19.958 --> 59:21.291
Three, two…

59:22.333 --> 59:23.333
-Oscar.
-Go!

59:24.458 --> 59:26.708
-Come on, Jasmine!
-Okay!

59:26.791 --> 59:28.208
How you doing, cute stuff?

59:30.458 --> 59:32.291
Go!

59:32.375 --> 59:33.750
Get up, girl!

59:33.833 --> 59:34.750
Here.

59:34.833 --> 59:37.916
Dawn, what are you doing?
Leave her! Get your butt to the maze!

59:42.208 --> 59:43.291
Go!

59:44.333 --> 59:46.750
Oh, hell no. Cindy, get up on this thing.

59:52.291 --> 59:53.666
-That's scary.
-Yeah.

59:53.750 --> 59:55.291
Come on, we can still win this!

59:56.166 --> 59:57.708
-Come on.
-Oh.

59:57.791 --> 01:00:00.083
-Hurry up.
-They've used random mouse algorithm.

01:00:00.166 --> 01:00:02.750
-I have no idea what you said.
-I know where we're going.

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:03.750
Come on, girl.

01:00:05.291 --> 01:00:06.583
-Let's go.
-Get in here.

01:00:07.416 --> 01:00:08.500
Okay.

01:00:08.583 --> 01:00:09.416
Come on.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.125
-Straight. Right!
-Right.

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:12.166
Keep going.

01:00:13.583 --> 01:00:15.250
-It's this way!
-Where are you going?

01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:17.666
-We have to follow Jasmine!
-What does she know?

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:18.583
She's a genius!

01:00:20.125 --> 01:00:22.875
Oh no. The wrong way. Ow, my knee.

01:00:22.958 --> 01:00:25.041
-Work together!
-Left, right! Left, right!

01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:29.166
-Girl, I don't--
-Okay, got my bucket.

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:30.583
Come on!

01:00:30.666 --> 01:00:33.041
-Why are you so mean to me? I'm trying.
-Because…

01:00:34.708 --> 01:00:35.708
Hey, baby!

01:00:35.791 --> 01:00:37.666
-That was so good.
-We made it!

01:00:38.708 --> 01:00:40.500
-Oh no!
-Oh!

01:00:42.125 --> 01:00:45.041
Yes, that's it. All right. Good job.

01:00:45.125 --> 01:00:46.666
Oh, crap. We forgot our buckets.

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:49.750
Once you get to the plank,
every woman for herself!

01:00:53.125 --> 01:00:54.000
Ooh!

01:00:59.958 --> 01:01:01.625
You're going down.

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:04.875
You first.

01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:15.000
You're going down!

01:01:24.916 --> 01:01:27.250
Get her, Dawn!

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:28.958
Strong thighs!

01:01:29.041 --> 01:01:30.333
Pilates, baby!

01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:33.791
Hey, Prince.

01:01:33.875 --> 01:01:36.250
-Great job. All right!
-Mud pit! Let's go!

01:01:39.458 --> 01:01:42.041
Get off me, you redneck bitch!

01:01:42.125 --> 01:01:43.875
-Spike, clear the shot!
-What?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.166
Get over here!

01:01:50.666 --> 01:01:51.666
I'm coming in!

01:01:58.625 --> 01:02:01.000
I can't handle this anymore.

01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:05.458
This is not my fairy tale ending.
I want out!

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:09.291
And I want a cheeseburger!

01:02:09.375 --> 01:02:11.041
This is amazing!

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:13.916
Hey, Carl, can you let go of Frank?
You're ruining the shot.

01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:19.541
Hey, break it up, ladies! Break it up!

01:02:20.083 --> 01:02:22.250
Actually, this is sexy as hell!

01:02:22.333 --> 01:02:23.250
Whoa, easy.

01:02:23.333 --> 01:02:25.291
All right. All right..

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:27.291
Come on, now. Let me. Let go.

01:02:27.375 --> 01:02:29.166
Easy, tiger.

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:30.500
Shut up, Heather!

01:02:31.333 --> 01:02:32.208
You're doing great.

01:02:32.291 --> 01:02:33.375
Bitch.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:34.666
Oh.

01:02:40.166 --> 01:02:43.083
I declare Jasmine
the winner of this challenge!

01:02:43.166 --> 01:02:44.125
What?

01:02:44.791 --> 01:02:47.416
Hey, attaboy, Oscar.
You said that with some cojones.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.125
That's what I'm talking about. My boy.

01:02:49.208 --> 01:02:50.500
Dawn, hang on.

01:02:50.583 --> 01:02:53.625
I want to get testimonials from
Dawn and Lexie before we hose them off.

01:02:53.708 --> 01:02:56.583
-No. No more testimonials!
-Dawn. Come back.

01:02:56.666 --> 01:02:58.250
Get back here.

01:02:58.333 --> 01:02:59.875
No, don't press that button!

01:03:02.583 --> 01:03:04.208
Oh, shoot! What is that?

01:03:07.125 --> 01:03:09.750
-It's broken. I don't know.
-This is so loud!

01:03:10.958 --> 01:03:12.958
The horses!

01:03:13.041 --> 01:03:14.000
Get back!

01:03:16.166 --> 01:03:18.958
-Oh my God, the horses!
-Get behind the wagon!

01:03:21.875 --> 01:03:23.291
Dawn, get out of there! Dawn!

01:03:23.375 --> 01:03:24.333
Amber! Look out!

01:03:29.541 --> 01:03:31.875
Why are you hiding behind me?

01:03:31.958 --> 01:03:34.375
-What's happening?
-Everybody keep calm!

01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:45.166
Oh, what the hell?

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:47.916
-Oh, they are gone.
-What just happened?

01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:49.750
Oh my God.

01:03:49.833 --> 01:03:51.125
Everyone okay?

01:03:56.375 --> 01:03:58.125
Hey, Trey, let's get a sound bite--

01:03:58.208 --> 01:04:01.708
Carl, I'm not thinking about your show
right now. I gotta go save my horses.

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:07.000
Jesus, I'm gonna ride out back.
Take a walkie.

01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:08.375
-Okay.
-Grab the trailer.

01:04:08.458 --> 01:04:10.916
I'll meet you out there.
Hey, what are you doing?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.333
Come on, you could use the extra hand.

01:04:14.625 --> 01:04:15.750
Let me help.

01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:17.333
She does have skills.

01:04:36.041 --> 01:04:37.291
There they are.

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:39.166
Whoa.

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:41.291
-These are the last two, right?
-That's it.

01:04:43.916 --> 01:04:46.166
We got Carmen and her foal.
We'll pony them back.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.208
Great news. See you at the ranch.

01:04:48.291 --> 01:04:50.458
-Shall we get them?
-Hopefully they don't run.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.083
Thank you.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:03.708
Hey, come here.

01:05:17.791 --> 01:05:19.625
Come on. There she is.

01:05:21.958 --> 01:05:23.125
Let's go home.

01:05:23.208 --> 01:05:24.125
Come on.

01:05:27.916 --> 01:05:29.625
Appreciate your help today.

01:05:30.125 --> 01:05:31.208
You're welcome.

01:05:31.291 --> 01:05:34.000
I guess horses and reality TV
don't really mix, do they?

01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:36.041
No. No, they do not.

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:39.541
How did Hollywood find you here anyway?

01:05:39.625 --> 01:05:42.208
Something I did
about a year ago went viral.

01:05:43.583 --> 01:05:47.250
-That's it? That's all you're gonna say?
-That's all you get.

01:05:47.333 --> 01:05:49.666
-What did you go viral for?
-Oh God.

01:05:50.333 --> 01:05:54.291
There was a kitten stuck up in a tree,
and I was just riding by and I--

01:05:54.375 --> 01:05:55.541
-Oh my God.
-What?

01:05:55.625 --> 01:05:58.291
Oh my God. You're "Cowboy Saves Kitten."

01:05:58.375 --> 01:06:00.416
-No.
-You are. That's you.

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.333
Nope.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:03.750
How did I never put this together?
This is amazing.

01:06:03.833 --> 01:06:06.791
When you handed it
to that little girl who was crying?

01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:07.833
Uh-huh.

01:06:08.416 --> 01:06:09.666
My heart melted a little.

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:11.916
If I'd known
that was gonna get your attention,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.875
I would've just stashed kittens
all the way around this ranch.

01:06:18.125 --> 01:06:19.333
This is really nice.

01:06:20.291 --> 01:06:21.500
-Being out here.
-Mm.

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:24.875
You're an enigma, you know that?

01:06:25.625 --> 01:06:26.458
Why?

01:06:26.541 --> 01:06:28.750
One minute,
I'm convinced you hate this life,

01:06:28.833 --> 01:06:31.250
the next, I can't see you
doing anything different.

01:06:31.833 --> 01:06:32.916
I don't hate this.

01:06:34.833 --> 01:06:37.458
I just hate that it's
the only thing I've ever known.

01:06:38.458 --> 01:06:39.500
Yeah?

01:06:50.166 --> 01:06:52.125
Well, it's been quite the day.

01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:56.708
My final spur goes to…

01:07:05.583 --> 01:07:06.416
Dawn.

01:07:07.291 --> 01:07:08.333
Cindy's out.

01:07:08.416 --> 01:07:09.458
Aww.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.208
Will you accept this spur?

01:07:18.416 --> 01:07:20.541
No, I forfeit my winnings to stay!

01:07:22.041 --> 01:07:23.791
-Can she do that?
-She could.

01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:25.291
But she hasn't won anything.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:26.291
I…

01:07:27.625 --> 01:07:28.583
love you, Trey.

01:07:28.666 --> 01:07:31.750
And I know we can make this work.

01:07:31.833 --> 01:07:33.458
You haven't won anything, Cindy.

01:07:34.875 --> 01:07:35.791
Oh.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.333
But…

01:07:40.666 --> 01:07:45.000
I won this crown,
and that took real dedication.

01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:50.333
She really loved him.

01:07:51.166 --> 01:07:52.041
Okay.

01:07:53.583 --> 01:07:54.541
Come here.

01:07:56.666 --> 01:07:58.916
You did so good. Amazing.

01:08:04.041 --> 01:08:05.416
-Bye, Cindy.
-Bye.

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.541
Bye, girl.

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:08.208
I'll miss you.

01:08:08.958 --> 01:08:10.125
She's a fruit loop.

01:08:10.708 --> 01:08:14.208
Oh, the show gave me this
before the ceremony.

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:16.708
-Should I read it? Yeah? Okay, all right.
-Yes!

01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:18.625
"We promise that this is your chance

01:08:18.708 --> 01:08:21.541
to travel with Trey
all the way to France."

01:08:22.583 --> 01:08:25.208
"Make sure Trey knows who best to cherish,

01:08:25.291 --> 01:08:28.375
because only the last two will go to…"

01:08:29.583 --> 01:08:31.166
"…Paris."

01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:32.291
Paris?

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:35.333
We're going to Paris after all!

01:08:37.750 --> 01:08:39.375
-Sorry, honey. Excuse me.
-Okay.

01:08:40.541 --> 01:08:42.666
That must have been some roundup today.

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:45.416
Oh. What's going on?

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.791
Really clever way
to get a date without earning it.

01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:50.791
Yeah, I'm so glad my stampede plan worked.

01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:53.416
There is something sus about you.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:56.875
-I didn't see you offering to help.
-I got my eye on her.

01:08:56.958 --> 01:08:59.291
We've all got our eyes on her.
She's on the monitor.

01:08:59.375 --> 01:09:01.500
I haven't figured it out yet,
but when I do,

01:09:01.583 --> 01:09:04.791
I'm betting the only spurs
you're walking out of here with

01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:08.333
are the ones on your crusty old boots.

01:09:12.083 --> 01:09:13.083
Excuse me, honey.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:31.916
Have fun.

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:42.416
Why are you so freaking fast?
What time is it?

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.916
Almost 6:00. Don't worry about it.

01:09:50.958 --> 01:09:53.083
-The best thing about electric trucks?
-What?

01:09:53.708 --> 01:09:56.250
They don't make a sound
when you're sneaking out. Ready?

01:09:56.333 --> 01:09:58.166
-Hell yeah, let's get out of here.
-Yeah.

01:10:01.708 --> 01:10:03.208
Feels like a getaway

01:10:03.291 --> 01:10:04.958
Whoo!

01:10:05.041 --> 01:10:06.041
So long, Carl.

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:10.416
I'm so happy to get out of there.

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.875
It's so nice there's no more cameras.
This is great.

01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:14.625
-So where are you taking me?
-Ooh.

01:10:14.708 --> 01:10:17.083
I cannot tell you.
I have an idea in my head.

01:10:17.166 --> 01:10:18.958
-Can't tell me, huh?
-Nope.

01:10:19.041 --> 01:10:21.000
-All right, cool. I like surprises.
-Good.

01:10:22.375 --> 01:10:27.541
Just take me anywhere and everywhere

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:34.458
So this is it?

01:10:34.541 --> 01:10:37.416
Yeah, there's a, uh, little trail
through the woods there.

01:10:39.208 --> 01:10:42.541
Wait. Is this where you take me
to the woods and you murder me?

01:10:42.625 --> 01:10:45.166
Oh yeah. Oh, I forgot
my chainsaw back at the house.

01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:47.666
-You mind if I grab that?
-Yeah, next time we come.

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:50.250
Yeah, that's fine.
You would make great compost.

01:10:50.333 --> 01:10:51.166
Thanks.

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:55.250
-Big old step. There you go.
-Whoop!

01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:03.583
This is stunning.

01:11:03.666 --> 01:11:05.125
It's my favorite spot.

01:11:05.208 --> 01:11:06.291
It's my hideout.

01:11:12.166 --> 01:11:15.125
So how'd you find this place?
Are we still on the ranch?

01:11:15.208 --> 01:11:17.375
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

01:11:17.458 --> 01:11:20.208
I got lost one day when I was about 12.

01:11:20.958 --> 01:11:23.416
And stumbled upon this place.

01:11:24.666 --> 01:11:27.750
It seems I keep finding
the best things when I least expect it.

01:11:29.958 --> 01:11:32.458
I couldn't believe it
when you walked in that first day.

01:11:32.541 --> 01:11:33.833
Why, what'd you think?

01:11:33.916 --> 01:11:36.041
"There's the crazy girl from the bar
with the spurs"?

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.208
Oh, now, don't sell yourself short.

01:11:38.291 --> 01:11:40.583
Crazy, yeah. Just a little bit.

01:11:40.666 --> 01:11:42.583
The spurs were great, but…

01:11:43.625 --> 01:11:45.541
But you were a sight to behold that night.

01:11:46.458 --> 01:11:47.291
Truly.

01:11:50.541 --> 01:11:51.708
God, I really like you.

01:11:53.541 --> 01:11:55.041
I really like you too.

01:11:56.458 --> 01:11:57.833
But I wish I didn't.

01:11:58.958 --> 01:12:00.458
Hm. Okay.

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:02.583
Now, why's that?

01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:07.291
The timing sucks and the show sucks.

01:12:07.375 --> 01:12:08.375
Hm.

01:12:10.583 --> 01:12:12.750
I just, I really wish that I…

01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:16.916
I could've gotten to know you
under different circumstances.

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:19.166
Did you know

01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:22.625
that I went back to the bar the night
after we first met looking for you?

01:12:23.333 --> 01:12:24.791
-You did?
-Yeah, I did.

01:12:25.583 --> 01:12:26.583
And you weren't there.

01:12:27.583 --> 01:12:31.291
Point is, in real life, we weren't given
the chance to get to know each other.

01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:34.208
But here, on this show, we have.

01:12:35.791 --> 01:12:37.083
And for that, I'm grateful.

01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:39.125
Me too.

01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:44.541
You and I have something special, Dawn.

01:12:46.125 --> 01:12:49.166
I don't… I don't know why
you keep trying to pretend we don't.

01:12:52.708 --> 01:12:54.625
I don't think I want to anymore.

01:13:45.958 --> 01:13:46.875
Ahh!

01:13:47.708 --> 01:13:49.500
-Sup?
-Howdy.

01:14:11.416 --> 01:14:14.833
I can't believe I grew up right around
here and didn't even know it existed.

01:14:14.916 --> 01:14:16.416
How far away is your house?

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.041
Like, 45 minutes.

01:14:18.125 --> 01:14:20.208
Oh. Why don't we go there?

01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:22.000
Right now?

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:25.375
Yeah, why not? You could, uh…
You could show me your art.

01:14:27.291 --> 01:14:28.291
I don't know.

01:14:29.541 --> 01:14:30.916
My art is just…

01:14:31.625 --> 01:14:33.041
-It's kind of personal.
-Mm.

01:14:33.125 --> 01:14:34.666
And what we did back there wasn't?

01:14:38.916 --> 01:14:42.791
There's no one else, it's only you
And we're the perfect fit

01:14:42.875 --> 01:14:44.333
You're right. I wanna go to the show.

01:14:44.416 --> 01:14:47.250
-No, we're going to my house.
-I wanna go back and do the show.

01:14:47.333 --> 01:14:48.166
We're going now.

01:14:52.958 --> 01:14:57.416
Tell me what you want
I'll be the girl of your dreams

01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:00.041
Love me like I need
I'll give you everything…

01:15:00.125 --> 01:15:01.458
This is it.

01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:04.625
This is amazing.

01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:09.500
-Wow, you did all this?
-Yeah.

01:15:11.666 --> 01:15:12.791
Really?

01:15:14.458 --> 01:15:15.333
This is gorgeous.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:17.916
Huh.

01:15:19.291 --> 01:15:23.250
I'm picking up some vibes from it.
I'm sensing something…

01:15:23.333 --> 01:15:25.166
We've got a ladder, right?

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:29.125
Climbing our way up and then, it's broken.
Broken, broken, broken.

01:15:34.083 --> 01:15:35.833
What's the golden apple mean?

01:15:36.416 --> 01:15:39.333
The apple represents the impossible dream.

01:15:40.208 --> 01:15:41.791
And what's that dream for you?

01:15:43.708 --> 01:15:45.791
A girl can't give away all her secrets.

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:48.541
You haven't told me any.
Oh, wait, no. You did tell me one.

01:15:48.625 --> 01:15:51.166
You want to go to France.
Hey, I got an idea.

01:15:52.958 --> 01:15:56.291
What would you say to coming
to France with me? Hm? For the finale.

01:15:57.041 --> 01:15:58.625
-Really?
-Yeah, why not?

01:15:59.875 --> 01:16:02.166
You know, finish out the rest of the show.

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:03.708
Spend a couple of weeks there.

01:16:03.791 --> 01:16:06.916
And if we still feel the same way
that I think we do,

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.458
come back to Texas with me.

01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:11.166
Give this thing a real shot.
What do you say?

01:16:13.416 --> 01:16:14.250
Come back?

01:16:15.666 --> 01:16:17.250
-Who's there?
-Oh!

01:16:17.333 --> 01:16:18.250
Birdie, it's me!

01:16:18.833 --> 01:16:19.666
Dawn?

01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:21.625
Well, who's that?

01:16:21.708 --> 01:16:25.208
Uh, Trey McAllen, ma'am.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

01:16:25.291 --> 01:16:27.625
-He's from The Honey Pot.
-Ahh.

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:29.416
You don't sound French.

01:16:30.541 --> 01:16:33.125
-Trade you.
-So, Paris, Texas.

01:16:33.208 --> 01:16:36.083
That's a pretty crazy twist.

01:16:36.833 --> 01:16:39.958
So I'm guessing you and Dawn
are getting along on that show?

01:16:40.041 --> 01:16:42.500
Oh, yeah, I'd say we are, actually.
What do you think?

01:16:43.375 --> 01:16:45.291
Maxine, can you grab the milk?

01:16:45.375 --> 01:16:48.291
Oh, I can get that.
Out in the barn with the cows?

01:16:48.375 --> 01:16:50.208
No, it's just in the fridge.

01:16:50.291 --> 01:16:51.291
Okay, I got you.

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.375
He's hot.

01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:58.958
-Dawn, are these your parents?
-Oh, uh…

01:16:59.041 --> 01:17:00.458
Yeah, that's my mom and dad.

01:17:01.125 --> 01:17:04.291
That's her daddy, Alex.
And that's my daughter, Jenny.

01:17:04.375 --> 01:17:07.625
She was the art teacher here
until she passed.

01:17:07.708 --> 01:17:08.833
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:11.791
She would be so proud
of Dawn getting into art s--

01:17:11.875 --> 01:17:14.666
-Trey is "Cowboy Saves Kitten."
-Oh.

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:16.458
-No way!
-Yeah, that's him.

01:17:16.541 --> 01:17:17.416
Yep.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:18.500
Ohh!

01:17:18.583 --> 01:17:19.916
Oh God, there it is.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Do you mind getting eggs
out of the chicken coop?

01:17:22.083 --> 01:17:23.583
-It's right by the barn.
-Gotcha.

01:17:24.166 --> 01:17:28.250
Watch out for the rooster.
He doesn't like male competition.

01:17:28.333 --> 01:17:29.541
Yes, ma'am.

01:17:31.333 --> 01:17:32.916
You were right.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.583
Hey, don't mention
art school to Trey, okay?

01:17:35.666 --> 01:17:36.708
Why not?

01:17:36.791 --> 01:17:40.625
He doesn't know that when the show comes
to an end, I plan on staying in Paris.

01:17:40.708 --> 01:17:42.916
I just have to find
the right time to tell him.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.125
Oh, son of a biscuit! Get off!

01:17:47.208 --> 01:17:48.583
Rooster got him!

01:17:48.666 --> 01:17:50.958
That rascal.

01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:52.708
I'm really sorry about your hand.

01:17:52.791 --> 01:17:55.291
No, it's fine. I really like your family.

01:17:55.916 --> 01:17:57.750
-They're great.
-They liked you too.

01:17:57.833 --> 01:17:58.875
Good.

01:17:58.958 --> 01:18:02.791
Hey, you even won over Maxine,
and that is not an easy thing to do.

01:18:02.875 --> 01:18:06.208
I think she's fantastic,
and we're going to be best buds.

01:18:06.833 --> 01:18:07.916
Yeah.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.041
She is pretty great.

01:18:09.125 --> 01:18:11.500
Spend a lot of time
with your grandmother growing up?

01:18:13.125 --> 01:18:16.416
My parents died in a car accident
when we were really young.

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:19.916
So, yeah, Birdie raised us.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.166
How about you? Do you have siblings?

01:18:23.458 --> 01:18:24.500
God, no.

01:18:25.166 --> 01:18:28.125
My parents barely stayed married
long enough to have me.

01:18:28.208 --> 01:18:29.833
So, nothing.

01:18:29.916 --> 01:18:30.875
Was it lonely?

01:18:31.916 --> 01:18:33.416
I've grown used to it.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.125
You know, I kind of thought
that if I worked really hard

01:18:36.208 --> 01:18:39.916
and I got the ranch back up and running,
I'd have everything I ever wanted.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.166
And do you?

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.833
It would be perfect if I had
somebody to share it with.

01:18:50.416 --> 01:18:53.125
-I need to tell you something.
-It's gonna have to wait.

01:18:53.208 --> 01:18:54.416
Where have you been?

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.708
-We got the welcoming committee.
-Out!

01:18:58.416 --> 01:18:59.875
This is ridiculous.

01:19:00.541 --> 01:19:03.208
Nice of you two to finally
grace us with your presence.

01:19:03.916 --> 01:19:05.916
Hey, Trey, you have to go and get changed.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.208
You and Jasmine have a date
at the John Deere factory.

01:19:08.291 --> 01:19:09.500
Yes, absolutely right.

01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:12.125
This is the second time
you've gone incommunicado on us.

01:19:12.208 --> 01:19:14.625
Next time, you'll both be hearing
from our lawyers.

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:16.208
Relax, Carl. It was my idea.

01:19:16.291 --> 01:19:19.541
All interaction between you two
will be in an official capacity.

01:19:19.625 --> 01:19:21.541
You will have cameras, you will have crew,

01:19:21.625 --> 01:19:26.375
you will have unrealistic dates in fantasy
settings with incredible production value!

01:19:27.875 --> 01:19:28.708
All right.

01:19:29.208 --> 01:19:32.000
Just be pert and peppy
for the next elimination.

01:19:33.416 --> 01:19:34.250
See ya.

01:19:35.291 --> 01:19:36.125
Dawn!

01:19:36.791 --> 01:19:39.291
Hey, Trey, can I, uh,
talk to you for a sec?

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:40.750
Can it wait two minutes?

01:19:40.833 --> 01:19:43.958
Oh, no, trust me.
You're going to want to hear this.

01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:46.416
Okay. Uh…

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.875
-Yeah, come on inside.
-All right.

01:19:51.625 --> 01:19:53.541
Yes, I finally won a date.

01:19:54.583 --> 01:19:57.458
-Jasmine, will you accept the spur?
-I will!

01:19:57.541 --> 01:19:58.458
Thank you.

01:20:03.416 --> 01:20:06.333
And the, uh, final spur
of the night goes to…

01:20:08.958 --> 01:20:11.708
a girl who opened my eyes
to something I didn't see coming.

01:20:21.166 --> 01:20:23.458
And, uh, that girl is…

01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:31.958
Lexie.

01:20:32.041 --> 01:20:32.958
What?

01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:39.375
Lexie?

01:20:43.125 --> 01:20:44.666
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:20:51.375 --> 01:20:52.375
Trey.

01:20:53.583 --> 01:20:54.708
I don't understand.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.125
Oh, I thought you'd be happy
to start packing.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.375
What are you talking about?
What does that mean?

01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:04.875
That means you got
what you wanted, doesn't it?

01:21:07.125 --> 01:21:09.125
-Something's wrong.
-Yeah.

01:21:10.875 --> 01:21:11.750
Trey, wait!

01:21:12.333 --> 01:21:13.208
Hey.

01:21:13.291 --> 01:21:14.833
Sorry, you can't follow him.

01:21:17.666 --> 01:21:18.708
You have to go pack.

01:21:20.166 --> 01:21:22.125
I know you're the reason he cut Dawn.

01:21:22.208 --> 01:21:23.833
Hey, I saved Trey from that snake.

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:25.791
I'm sorry, Dawn.

01:22:06.333 --> 01:22:07.458
Thanks.

01:22:10.416 --> 01:22:13.666
Okay, you know what? I'm going to say it.
I don't get this Trey guy.

01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:16.708
Because I saw the two of you together,
and he was way feeling you.

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:19.750
I really thought that we had something.

01:22:21.416 --> 01:22:22.708
Honey, I'm sorry.

01:22:23.916 --> 01:22:27.041
I really thought he was nice.
I'm surprised too.

01:22:27.125 --> 01:22:29.000
I'm just glad that cock got him.

01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:32.166
So when do you leave?

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:35.541
That came out wrong.

01:22:35.625 --> 01:22:39.416
Tomorrow night. I still have to sign up
for classes and get an apartment.

01:22:40.375 --> 01:22:42.166
I'm really sorry that it's so soon.

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:43.583
Me too.

01:22:45.208 --> 01:22:47.500
But I sort of already
moved into your room.

01:22:48.833 --> 01:22:51.750
Do you still need a ride
to the library, you little brat?

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:52.791
Em's taking me.

01:22:52.875 --> 01:22:53.875
Oh.

01:22:53.958 --> 01:22:55.875
We're going to get milkshakes after.

01:22:55.958 --> 01:23:00.041
Honey, we're just fine.
You know I'm so proud of you.

01:23:00.125 --> 01:23:02.458
It was messy, but somehow, someway,

01:23:02.541 --> 01:23:06.458
you have managed
to get yourself to Paris, France.

01:23:06.541 --> 01:23:08.333
That's something.

01:23:08.416 --> 01:23:10.833
Ah.

01:23:10.916 --> 01:23:12.458
It's your turn now.

01:23:31.166 --> 01:23:33.958
The way I wanna kiss you
In this autumn light

01:23:34.041 --> 01:23:37.166
I've never been real close
But I wanna try

01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:38.250
Wanna try

01:23:38.333 --> 01:23:40.916
You make me change my mind

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:46.583
I could cry, aching to be close
So we could burn it down

01:23:46.666 --> 01:23:49.708
Fly across the ocean
'Cause I know I found

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:53.375
The only person
Who could ever change my mind

01:23:53.875 --> 01:23:55.958
So meet me in Paris

01:23:57.166 --> 01:24:00.750
And say that you love me

01:24:00.833 --> 01:24:05.875
Just leave everything, it don't matter
'Cause we are in love

01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:08.666
Meet me in Paris

01:24:09.666 --> 01:24:13.125
Down by the river

01:24:13.625 --> 01:24:19.000
It's now or it's never
I hope it's forever with doves

01:24:19.083 --> 01:24:21.375
Meet me in Paris

01:24:23.083 --> 01:24:27.500
Won't you?

01:24:38.291 --> 01:24:40.791
Meet me in Paris

01:24:42.291 --> 01:24:45.458
Won't you?

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:49.375
-You're doing good work.
-Thank you.

01:24:50.958 --> 01:24:54.416
Oh in Paris, in Paris

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.166
In Paris

01:24:58.583 --> 01:25:00.791
Paris

01:25:01.875 --> 01:25:03.833
-Mmm
-Merci.

01:25:06.958 --> 01:25:07.833
May I?

01:25:12.833 --> 01:25:16.666
Well, I promise I'm not stalking you.
Accounting gave me your address.

01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:21.083
I was actually on my way to your flat
when I spotted you, so, voilà.

01:25:21.166 --> 01:25:22.708
So you were looking for me?

01:25:22.791 --> 01:25:26.083
I thought you might want to know
that we're shooting the finale tomorrow.

01:25:26.958 --> 01:25:28.750
I couldn't care less about that show.

01:25:28.833 --> 01:25:30.375
Oh. Okay.

01:25:33.916 --> 01:25:35.541
Who's in the finale?

01:25:35.625 --> 01:25:38.916
I thought you'd never ask.
We're down to Jasmine and Lexie.

01:25:41.166 --> 01:25:43.125
But I'm still rooting for you and Trey.

01:25:43.208 --> 01:25:47.041
Did you miss the humiliating moment
when he kicked me off the show?

01:25:47.125 --> 01:25:49.416
No, I was there. I saw.
I had a front row seat.

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:53.083
I also saw when Lexie
showed him your letter from art school.

01:25:53.166 --> 01:25:54.375
-What?
-Yeah.

01:25:54.458 --> 01:25:57.625
She made sure to point out
that it was a two-year program.

01:25:59.916 --> 01:26:02.166
He thinks that the whole time
I was lying to him.

01:26:02.916 --> 01:26:05.666
Well, you kind of were, Dawn.
Just a little bit.

01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:07.583
Yeah, but I had my reasons.

01:26:07.666 --> 01:26:09.375
Oh, I know. But Trey doesn't.

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:11.666
But he could.

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:14.166
How?

01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:16.666
You forfeit your winnings
and come back on the show,

01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:18.541
like Cinderella tried to that one time.

01:26:18.625 --> 01:26:23.166
I really want to explain everything
to Trey, but I can't do it on camera.

01:26:24.125 --> 01:26:27.333
If I do it on camera, he's not gonna
believe a single word that I say.

01:26:27.416 --> 01:26:29.458
You know that's not how it works, right?

01:26:29.541 --> 01:26:33.333
Yeah, but it's the finale. He's gonna
think I'm just there to win the money.

01:26:33.416 --> 01:26:35.291
Maybe, or maybe not.

01:26:35.375 --> 01:26:37.541
But don't you think
he should know the full story

01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:41.291
before he makes the biggest decision
of his life? Come on, Dawn.

01:26:41.375 --> 01:26:43.666
I can't afford to give up my winnings.

01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:47.541
I can barely afford to be here right now.

01:26:47.625 --> 01:26:49.416
No, I get it. I get it.

01:26:50.291 --> 01:26:51.875
If you change your mind,

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:55.375
we're shooting tomorrow night
at Café de L'Homme

01:26:56.208 --> 01:26:58.500
and it's possible
that there's a beautiful dress

01:26:58.583 --> 01:27:00.958
being delivered to your flat as we speak.

01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:04.625
But if you don't come, please definitely
keep the tags on. It has to go back.

01:27:04.708 --> 01:27:07.208
-I'll leave them on.
-Mm-hm.

01:27:09.083 --> 01:27:10.125
Huh.

01:27:10.833 --> 01:27:13.416
It's interesting.
There's so much inspiration in the city,

01:27:14.125 --> 01:27:17.500
and yet that's where you draw yours from.

01:27:23.208 --> 01:27:25.583
Maybe it wasn't the wrong Paris after all.

01:27:25.666 --> 01:27:27.000
Just think about it, Dawn.

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.000
Trey, let's get you suited.

01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:52.833
So, it's like we already went over.

01:27:52.916 --> 01:27:55.333
The girls will arrive
one at a time on the terrace.

01:27:55.416 --> 01:27:57.708
Great. Let's just get this over with.

01:27:57.791 --> 01:28:00.166
-Come on, man. You're in Paree.
-Mm.

01:28:00.250 --> 01:28:02.666
About to pop the question
in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower.

01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:05.333
We know I have no intention
of marrying anyone, right?

01:28:05.416 --> 01:28:07.833
Don't worry. Lexie's a ringer
to get her own season,

01:28:07.916 --> 01:28:11.250
and Jasmine has a crush on Oscar
for some reason.

01:28:11.333 --> 01:28:12.166
Trey.

01:28:13.083 --> 01:28:14.916
-Oui.
-All right. Good chat.

01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:18.458
Grumpy's ready. What's your 20?

01:28:18.541 --> 01:28:22.333
Almost there. It's right around
the corner. Thank you, merci.

01:28:24.875 --> 01:28:26.250
-Carl?
-I'm here.

01:28:26.333 --> 01:28:28.250
-Yeah, we just landed. Uh-huh.
-Great.

01:28:28.875 --> 01:28:31.458
Oh my God. She came. Hey, Carl.

01:28:31.541 --> 01:28:34.291
Change of plans.
Uh, we have a surprise visitor.

01:28:36.458 --> 01:28:37.541
I hate surprises.

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:40.333
Dawn?

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.750
-What the hell is she doing here?
-Hey! Circle the block!

01:28:44.833 --> 01:28:47.458
-And don't let them out until I call you.
-No, she can't!

01:28:50.916 --> 01:28:52.541
Dawn! Hey.

01:28:53.125 --> 01:28:55.166
-Oh my God, you look beautiful.
-Thank you.

01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:57.416
-Ah!
-I assume you take cash?

01:28:58.583 --> 01:29:01.666
-How much longer can you stay without it?
-Not as long as I'd hoped.

01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:04.750
No. No. No. No. No. Dawn can't be here.

01:29:04.833 --> 01:29:06.541
Actually, yes, she can.

01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:10.166
She forfeited her winnings
for a meeting with Trey.

01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:11.833
It's too late. It's the finale.

01:29:11.916 --> 01:29:14.666
Shut the hell up, Carl,
and please let me win us an Emmy.

01:29:16.208 --> 01:29:19.458
-Okay, so here's what we're going to do.
-Get cameras ready.

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.000
Stay back, Carl.

01:29:23.083 --> 01:29:24.250
I come in peace.

01:29:26.833 --> 01:29:30.000
Sound, can I get sound?
Hey, we need to get her wired right away.

01:29:30.083 --> 01:29:32.416
-I'm gonna rally the troops.
-Fantastic.

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:33.500
Where do I put it?

01:29:34.166 --> 01:29:35.000
Costumes!

01:29:35.583 --> 01:29:37.250
-What's the problem?
-Um, help.

01:29:38.166 --> 01:29:40.666
-We're gonna have to take this gown off.
-Not helpful.

01:29:55.083 --> 01:29:58.041
Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

01:29:58.125 --> 01:30:00.708
You got this. All right? You got this.

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:22.000
Trey?

01:30:26.375 --> 01:30:27.375
What's she doing here?

01:30:27.458 --> 01:30:28.750
Uh… Uh…

01:30:28.833 --> 01:30:31.958
I came to apologize and explain.

01:30:32.958 --> 01:30:34.083
There's really no need.

01:30:34.166 --> 01:30:37.583
You could have told me you were going
to art school. I'd have believed that.

01:30:37.666 --> 01:30:39.625
You didn't have to pretend to be into me.

01:30:39.708 --> 01:30:41.375
No, I wasn't pretending.

01:30:42.791 --> 01:30:44.916
Will you please just hear me out?

01:30:45.875 --> 01:30:50.000
Dawn, I would be lying to you if I said
I didn't think about you all the time.

01:30:51.083 --> 01:30:53.708
It looks really bad.
You show up on the night of the finale

01:30:53.791 --> 01:30:55.916
and there's a quarter million dollars
up for grabs.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.958
I know that it doesn't look good.

01:30:59.625 --> 01:31:01.416
But I'm not here for that.

01:31:02.875 --> 01:31:04.875
Yes, I needed the money for school,

01:31:04.958 --> 01:31:08.708
so I schemed my way
onto a reality dating show.

01:31:10.166 --> 01:31:11.333
And I fell in love.

01:31:13.083 --> 01:31:13.916
For real.

01:31:17.083 --> 01:31:18.625
Well, you're lucky, Dawn.

01:31:19.125 --> 01:31:20.125
Very lucky.

01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:23.375
Because I don't know if the woman
I fell in love with is real at all.

01:31:25.375 --> 01:31:28.708
When I asked you to come to Paris
with me, you said yes, right?

01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:32.500
What were you gonna do once you got here?

01:31:35.291 --> 01:31:36.125
Stay.

01:31:37.166 --> 01:31:38.000
There it is.

01:31:40.083 --> 01:31:41.458
For two years.

01:31:41.541 --> 01:31:45.416
You were just going to let me propose
to you in front of the entire world,

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:48.541
and then… you were just going to leave me?

01:31:50.291 --> 01:31:54.916
I don't know. I… I just hoped that maybe
we could figure it out together.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.458
How could we figure it out together
if you never told me?

01:32:00.291 --> 01:32:03.000
I really did try.

01:32:05.666 --> 01:32:06.541
Not hard enough.

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:14.625
I understand.

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:29.583
Goodbye, Trey.

01:32:46.541 --> 01:32:47.458
We can cut.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.291
Dawn! There you are!

01:32:58.125 --> 01:32:59.916
I have to go. I'm sorry.

01:33:01.041 --> 01:33:01.958
Trey.

01:33:02.041 --> 01:33:03.750
-I need a minute.
-I get it.

01:33:03.833 --> 01:33:06.625
-Rachel, I need a minute.
-I know, but you need to hear this.

01:33:06.708 --> 01:33:10.375
Dawn literally forfeited
all of her winnings just to come back.

01:33:11.458 --> 01:33:14.375
-Dawn gave up all that money?
-Every last penny. It was legit.

01:33:14.458 --> 01:33:17.166
No, Rachel. She needs that money
for school. Give that back.

01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:20.458
I can't. I'm so sorry.
She knew exactly what she was risking.

01:33:20.541 --> 01:33:22.750
-You've got to figure this out.
-I just saw Dawn.

01:33:23.250 --> 01:33:24.333
She was crying.

01:33:24.416 --> 01:33:26.875
What is going on?
This is just unprofessional.

01:33:26.958 --> 01:33:29.166
-Hey, hey. Where'd she go?
-Out front.

01:33:29.250 --> 01:33:30.291
Trey, where you going?

01:33:30.375 --> 01:33:33.250
Trey McAllen, don't you dare go after her!

01:33:33.333 --> 01:33:35.250
Oh no. No. Lexie? Lexie?

01:33:35.333 --> 01:33:36.583
No. Jasmine!

01:33:36.666 --> 01:33:38.458
Jasmine! Open the door.

01:33:38.541 --> 01:33:39.958
-Sorry!
-Open the door, Jasmine.

01:33:40.041 --> 01:33:42.083
-Open the door, Jasmine.
-I can't hear you.

01:33:42.166 --> 01:33:44.125
Can we get locations up here, please?

01:34:00.125 --> 01:34:01.333
Dawn!

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.208
Why'd you give up the money?

01:34:08.125 --> 01:34:09.958
Because you're my dream now too.

01:34:10.958 --> 01:34:12.750
And I wanted you to know that.

01:34:16.333 --> 01:34:17.500
God, I missed you.

01:34:18.583 --> 01:34:20.375
Does this mean that you forgive me?

01:34:22.166 --> 01:34:23.083
Yeah, it does.

01:34:27.458 --> 01:34:31.125
Listen to me. You have to stay, okay?
This is your chance.

01:34:31.208 --> 01:34:34.166
-I'll pay for your art school.
-No. I could never let you do that.

01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:36.708
Why do you have to be
so stubborn, huh? Why?

01:34:38.625 --> 01:34:40.916
-Everyone, places. Hurry.
-The cavalry's coming.

01:34:42.166 --> 01:34:44.333
-Why aren't their mics on?
-Working on it.

01:34:44.416 --> 01:34:46.833
You shouldn't have to choose
between Paris and us.

01:34:46.916 --> 01:34:48.583
No!

01:34:48.666 --> 01:34:49.708
I will fight you.

01:34:49.791 --> 01:34:52.583
I think I know of a way
that you can get both, okay?

01:34:52.666 --> 01:34:55.083
They can't force us to stay together,
but more importantly,

01:34:55.166 --> 01:34:56.875
they can't force us to stay apart.

01:34:57.791 --> 01:35:01.083
Here's the catch. The winnings
can't be shared between the two of us.

01:35:01.166 --> 01:35:04.541
But there's nothing to share.
I gave it all up so I could come back.

01:35:05.958 --> 01:35:07.583
Not if you win the whole Honey Pot.

01:35:11.083 --> 01:35:12.041
You trust me?

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:14.625
Yeah.

01:35:14.708 --> 01:35:15.625
Good.

01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:19.250
I'm ready to pop the question.

01:35:19.333 --> 01:35:20.541
Sound is back up.

01:35:23.875 --> 01:35:25.166
Merci.

01:35:33.291 --> 01:35:34.125
Dawn?

01:35:35.791 --> 01:35:38.000
I knew you were different
from the moment we met.

01:35:39.250 --> 01:35:41.833
And I ain't ever dated anyone
with bigger spurs than mine.

01:35:42.916 --> 01:35:44.125
It ain't easy.

01:35:44.208 --> 01:35:46.791
But you challenge me
in ways I didn't know I'd love.

01:35:48.333 --> 01:35:49.375
And I love you, Dawn.

01:35:49.458 --> 01:35:53.166
I do. And I'm so glad
we found each other in Paris.

01:35:54.166 --> 01:35:55.291
So I gotta ask.

01:35:57.291 --> 01:35:58.875
Will you take the money?

01:36:00.708 --> 01:36:01.958
Or will you take the honey?

01:36:09.625 --> 01:36:10.875
I love you too.

01:36:12.291 --> 01:36:13.416
So much.

01:36:19.625 --> 01:36:20.875
I'm gonna take the money.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Attagirl.

01:36:26.666 --> 01:36:27.916
Get up here and kiss me.

01:36:28.708 --> 01:36:29.541
Yes, ma'am.

01:36:42.625 --> 01:36:45.541
They can't do that.
Did they just hack my show?

01:36:45.625 --> 01:36:46.666
Our show.

01:36:47.166 --> 01:36:48.500
And yes, they did.

01:36:49.416 --> 01:36:51.666
It makes for one hell of an ending.

01:37:00.833 --> 01:37:03.541
So what does
this new life of ours look like?

01:37:03.625 --> 01:37:07.458
Well, I think it starts with you staying
here in Paris and finishing art school.

01:37:08.541 --> 01:37:09.583
And you?

01:37:10.583 --> 01:37:12.458
I think I kinda love this Paris.

01:37:12.541 --> 01:37:14.291
And I love Texas.

01:37:14.375 --> 01:37:16.291
And they do have airplanes.

01:37:16.375 --> 01:37:19.083
I think we can figure it out. Together.

01:37:19.791 --> 01:37:21.083
I think we can too.

01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:43.541
-Look at that.
-Look at how beautiful this is.

01:38:00.791 --> 01:38:02.833
Yeah I rock Gucci gang

01:38:02.916 --> 01:38:04.958
But I got Baytown twang

01:38:05.041 --> 01:38:07.333
That lifted pickup in the parking lot

01:38:07.416 --> 01:38:09.125
I own that thing

01:38:09.208 --> 01:38:13.375
Yeah, I know my drink
Might be all pretty pink

01:38:13.458 --> 01:38:17.500
But don't you let that fool you
I'm more backwoods than you think

01:38:17.583 --> 01:38:21.541
You'd never know it
It ain't showing in this downtown dress

01:38:21.625 --> 01:38:25.708
But let's just say that the shade
Of my lipstick matches my neck

01:38:25.791 --> 01:38:30.500
'Cause I can drive your truck
Faster than you can

01:38:30.583 --> 01:38:34.416
I can get it done
With my own two hands

01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:38.916
I can dance with the ladies
Drink with the fellers

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.416
You know Fridays are good

01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:41.333
Mark.

01:38:42.125 --> 01:38:43.083
Mark!

01:38:43.166 --> 01:38:44.500
So good, by the way.

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.250
It's not good. Never try it like that.

01:38:47.333 --> 01:38:49.375
My grandma made me these. But--

01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:54.375
I can do a… a three-leaf clover
with my tongue.

01:38:55.833 --> 01:38:57.666
-Hey, watch it!
-Oops.

01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:59.125
Oh my God. What am I doing?

01:38:59.208 --> 01:39:01.541
-I have lightning-fast reflexes.
-Do you now?

01:39:05.541 --> 01:39:09.041
What are you doing, Dawn?
Leave her! Get your butt to the maze.

01:39:09.125 --> 01:39:12.750
Is there a Paris in…
Nope. Sorry, that's not the line.

01:39:14.916 --> 01:39:17.416
Ooh, it's so warm.

01:39:18.541 --> 01:39:20.041
I'm hot just watching.

01:39:21.083 --> 01:39:26.416
Carl, we have discussed this.
This is my space bubble.

01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:29.125
Like, all of it. The entire circumference.

01:39:29.708 --> 01:39:31.291
-I'm hot just watching.
-Oh my God.

01:39:31.375 --> 01:39:32.500
-Yeah.
-This guy!

01:39:32.583 --> 01:39:34.500
-The Honey Pot
-Oh my God.

01:39:34.583 --> 01:39:36.416
You're going to The Honey Pot

01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:38.000
This horse is so small.

01:39:38.083 --> 01:39:42.291
But let me show you how
A country girl gets it done y'all

01:39:42.375 --> 01:39:44.833
-Please invert my necklace.
-Raise for me?

01:39:44.916 --> 01:39:45.791
Okay.

01:39:45.875 --> 01:39:46.750
Oh, never mind.

01:39:46.833 --> 01:39:47.833
The date tip.

01:39:49.416 --> 01:39:51.208
The date challenge.

01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:56.666
How did you know I was just thinking that?

01:39:59.041 --> 01:40:00.958
That's my Cindy siren song.

01:40:07.208 --> 01:40:09.750
So, extra points for spin, all right?

01:40:16.083 --> 01:40:18.500
I can't get on there. I'm disappointed.

01:40:21.208 --> 01:40:22.916
I didn't drink any of that.

01:40:28.625 --> 01:40:29.458
Whoo!

01:40:29.541 --> 01:40:32.500
Splash! Ah! Pow!

01:40:34.916 --> 01:40:39.375
I like motorcycles, tattoos,
guys with motorcycle tattoos.

01:40:39.458 --> 01:40:40.875
Heather, tell you what.

01:40:40.958 --> 01:40:43.291
I might do a French dude on a big scooter.

01:40:43.375 --> 01:40:47.000
I bet she could throw me around a room.
Break me in half, sew me back together.

01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:57.041
Now, we've got something big, special…

01:40:57.541 --> 01:40:59.000
That's not right.

01:41:00.125 --> 01:41:02.958
There's some word
that I gotta say right after that.

01:41:03.041 --> 01:41:04.500
Nummy, nummy, num, num.

01:41:05.083 --> 01:41:06.166
Ah! Go!

01:41:11.833 --> 01:41:13.625
I am so sorry, I got so excited.

01:41:20.291 --> 01:41:23.416
No hands. Look at that, no hands.
It's driving… It's driving itself.

01:41:24.416 --> 01:41:25.791
Oh!

01:41:25.875 --> 01:41:27.333
Cutting!

01:41:27.416 --> 01:41:30.166
Next, go! Go, move.

01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:31.083
Where do I look?

01:41:32.666 --> 01:41:34.916
I hate it, I don't like it. I hate it.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.583
I can get it done
With my own two hands

01:41:38.666 --> 01:41:41.458
I can dance with the ladies

01:41:41.541 --> 01:41:43.375
Drink with the fellers

01:41:43.458 --> 01:41:48.000
You know Fridays are good
But boy, with me they'd be better

01:41:48.083 --> 01:41:51.750
Country boys sure know how to have fun

01:41:51.833 --> 01:41:56.250
But let me show you how
A country girl gets it done y'all

01:41:57.083 --> 01:41:58.958
Trey is waiting for me!

01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:03.666
Hey, little buddy.

01:42:04.458 --> 01:42:06.791
Oh, son of a biscuit!

01:42:06.875 --> 01:42:09.208
Can I have some… …alcohol?

01:42:09.708 --> 01:42:12.125
Want to trade?
You want to ask me to marry you instead?

01:42:12.208 --> 01:42:13.916
Yeah, I'll marry… I do.

01:42:17.041 --> 01:42:18.166
She said no!

01:42:22.333 --> 01:42:23.625
I bet you can't keep up
