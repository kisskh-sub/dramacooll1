WEBVTT

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.200
From now on, we’ll have no other status
except being rivals.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.840
Hey.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.440
Everyone must have seen the rumors
about Khun Aiwarin of Orienna

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.080
and Khun Maevika of Superior.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.440
You can’t just accuse people
without evidence.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.160
But in some cases, even suspicion alone
can’t be ignored, right?

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.760
And if there’s clear evidence,
we definitely can’t.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.760
No filming, please.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.880
I won’t let you two off the hook.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.600
Cutting out another rival

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.320
means our chance
of winning the bid goes up, sir.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.840
- Perfect timing, I was just talking about,
- Everyone.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.120
Ai has something to announce.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.200
After the bidding ends,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.200
I’ll be resigning from here.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.280
And moving to Boston.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.600
I’ll have our staff

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.240
who’ve been working
with Bradley return to Thailand.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.600
I’ll take over the project myself.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.960
Everyone, please leave the room.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.280
I need to talk to my daughter.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.120
I won’t let you go anywhere.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.680
You must stay here

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.600
to run The Greater Duty Free.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.680
Don’t be so sure, Dad.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.240
That Orienna would win the auction.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.720
Even if our rivals are fewer.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.280
Or we think we’ve got the edge
over Superior.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.440
It doesn’t mean we’ll always win.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.479
Don’t forget.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.680
In every competition.

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.400
There’s always a surprise waiting.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.800
Ai thinks Dad should brace for it.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.600
I said no.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.280
No means no.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.680
Even if Orienna doesn’t win the auction.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.080
I won’t allow you to go anywhere.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.800
But Ai will go.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.960
And if Dad won’t let me.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.079
Then just take my life instead.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.200
Because it’s the only thing
I have left.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.079
Other than that.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.200
I’ve got nothing left for you, Dad.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:21.839
Hey you!

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.200
What kind of driving is that?
Were you even watching the road?

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.200
Sorry, Khun. I was picking things up,
I didn’t pay attention.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.600
Does your car even have insurance?

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.120
Hold on a sec.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.000
- My insurance just expired.
- Huh?

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.640
Then I’ll just cover my car myself.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.840
- And you handle your own car.
- How could you say that?

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.240
Give me your number first.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.360
You.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.120
Here.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.680
What’s this?

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480
Hey.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800
(Calling. What’s wrong?)

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.360
(Calling. What’s wrong?)

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.560
(Calling. What’s wrong?)

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.560
(Calling. What’s wrong?)

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.960
Nothing. I woke up,
you were gone, so I called.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.800
But I get it, you probably
don’t want to talk.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.600
(Nothing. I woke up, you were gone, so I called.
But I get it, you probably don’t want to talk.)

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.200
(Why would you think that?)

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.520
Because we broke up.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.600
(Because we broke up.)

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.840
(Do you want to meet tonight?
We could clear things up.)

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.280
Where?

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.760
(Where?)

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.800
Delete the chat.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.320
Block the account.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.840
So they can’t reach you.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.600
Okay.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.640
Here.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.680
A new phone to replace the one you lost.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.800
Thanks, P'G.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.640
As for the data Khun Mae back up on cloud.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.200
I already pulled it all back.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.440
Anything you didn’t back up.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.440
It’s gone with the phone.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.280
Did something happen?

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.920
Well

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.520
The chat with Aiwarin’s account is gone.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.400
Mae, you’re sure you
didn’t delete it yourself?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.480
I’m sure, P'G.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.320
Even though Mae broke up with her.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.000
It doesn’t mean
I’d cut her out of my life.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.800
Or maybe that thief.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.720
P'G.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.200
Mae’s worried.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.840
Something bad must’ve happened.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.520
Hello.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.320
(Yam)
Hey, where’s Khun Aiwarin?

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.640
Why?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.720
Just tell me first.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.720
She should be on her way.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.440
Heard she’s meeting
your boss to clear things up.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.600
- Your boss asked to see Ai.
- No, P'G!

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.000
So they set it up for tonight.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.680
At the seaside resort.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.560
Yam, can I have Khun Ai’s number?

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.320
Sure.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.080
But Khun Mae doesn’t have Khun Ai’s number?

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.280
Don’t ask more, just send it first.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.920
Alright.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.240
Got it.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.320
Sorry.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.520
- Sorry, the number you dialed cannot be
- Not connecting, P’G.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.280
Maybe she’s on a plane.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.640
Khun Mae, wait.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.840
Mae has to rush to him, P’G.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.480
Please handle the flight ticket for Mae.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Rachen.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.480
Where’s Maevika?

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.520
No need to waste time asking.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.880
She’s not here.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.120
The one you’ve been chatting with

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.320
it was me.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.200
I still remember.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.880
The day you told me
so confidently you were smart.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.400
I’d say today you’re dead wrong.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.320
Because standing here now

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.720
just proves you’re stupid.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.920
And the fact you could expose me

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.640
both in Boston and The Greater

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.000
I just slipped, that’s all.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.680
Today I’ll show you.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.200
Someone like me won’t slip for someone like you again.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.320
- Where are you going?
- Let go, let me go!

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.160
What are you gonna do?

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.440
I’ll make you live in nightmares forever.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.480
Pathetic.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.480
That’s all you’ve got?

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.280
Why not just kill me then?

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.000
- Don’t you dare me.
- I’m not daring.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.000
Because if I don’t die

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.080
I’ll come back for you again.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.920
And then you’ll come back for me.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.480
Yeah, to you

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.920
I might look dumb.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.520
But to me

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.440
you’re downright stupid.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.200
Open your mouth.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.520
- I said open!
- No!

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.920
- Eat it, swallow it.
- No.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.960
Eat.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.520
What did you put in the wine?

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.040
Something that’ll make you

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.360
submit to me.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.560
A woman who loves women, like you

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.800
If a clip leaks of you with a guy

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.080
- Where you going?
- Let go.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.320
- Where? Get back here.
- Let me go!

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.920
Think you’re so tough?

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.720
Think you’re so tough?

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.560
Your life had to run into me.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.720
Khun Ai!

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.640
Rachen!

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.000
Let Aiwarin go right now!

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.880
Hurry!

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.400
Or I’ll shoot you.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.400
Khun Mae.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.240
Khun Ai.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.800
Don’t.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.880
Khun Mae.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.120
Think you’re both so strong?

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.520
Then die together.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.120
Stop! Drop your weapon.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.320
I said drop it!

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.760
Don’t!

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.200
Let’s go to the hospital.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.800
- No.
- Please, go.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.320
No.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.840
You need to stay conscious.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.800
But I can’t hold on.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.600
You’re like this

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.600
because he drugged you.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.720
Khun Ai.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.520
Stay with me.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.200
Khun Ai.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.440
Khun Ai, focus.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.079
Please help me.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.240
Khun Ai.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.720
How are you feeling?

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.200
It’s okay now.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.600
Khun Mae is right here.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.400
And you, Khun Mae?

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.600
Does it hurt?

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.280
Yeah, it hurts.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.480
But not as bad as you, Khun Ai.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.400
Rachen dared go this far?

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.600
Yes, Dad.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.880
But

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.760
you don’t need to worry anymore.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.000
Mae and Aiwarin are safe now.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.680
Then hurry and come back.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.440
I’ll send word to Khun Attawit.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.120
I believe once he knows

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.320
he’ll worry about his daughter too.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.480
Yes, Dad.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.880
I’m such a mess.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.000
All this time I thought

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.080
I could handle someone like him.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.720
But in the end

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.560
I almost fell for it.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.480
Don’t beat yourself up.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.920
The reason you slipped

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.320
was because you thought you’d see me.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.360
Stop blaming yourself, okay?

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.240
Everything will pass soon.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.120
Tomorrow morning we’ll head back to Bangkok.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.280
I’ll take you home myself.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.360
Why home?

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.960
You should have someone with you.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.760
In case there are side effects from the drug.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.520
Just drop me at Orienna.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.920
I can take care of myself.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.200
You don’t want to see anyone yet, do you?

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.920
Then stay with me for now.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.520
Once you feel better

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.720
we can go our own ways.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.040
(How are you? I know everything now.)

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.080
Get some rest.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.200
Can we stay together a bit?

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.000
(I’ll go prep food. When you wake, wash up and change.)
(Mae)

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.200
Your skin is so beautiful.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.320
Glowing, radiant, so fresh.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.160
Yours is beautiful too.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.280
Not just beautiful

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.720
it smells good too.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.280
Khun Ai.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.280
Eat plenty, okay?

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.960
Orange juice for a beauty like Khun Ai.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.720
How are you, dear?

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.480
Must’ve been such a shock.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.480
(Hello.)

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.280
No need to worry anymore.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.680
I’ve already had it taken care of.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.560
Thank you so much.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.720
Mae.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.400
- Yes?
- Come here.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.160
We haven’t settled this yet.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.400
I’m sorry, Dad.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.200
You know it’s just the two of us, right?

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.640
You know that?

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.400
Yes, I know.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.960
Ai went inside the house.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.240
She said

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.200
you were at the company early this morning.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.680
How are things?

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.280
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.720
Do you really care about me, Dad?

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.640
Or are you just acting?

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.640
What are you saying?

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.200
You’re my daughter.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.160
I’m asking

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.200
because you’ve never done this before.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.480
Ever since I was little,growing up

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.800
no matter what I went through

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.800
you always said

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
I had to get back up on my own.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.960
Not once

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.600
did you ever hug or comfort me.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.600
I’m sorry.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.920
Being a father

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.800
raising a daughter alone

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.120
it’s never been easy, Aiwarin.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.200
Everything I did

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.800
it was because I believed

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.520
it was the best for you.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.640
It may not have been the way you wanted.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.880
But trust me

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.200
I never wished you harm.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.600
I have something to ask you, Dad.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.360
Where’s my mother?

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.680
Please tell me, Dad.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.200
Maybe your answer

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.280
could unlock something for me.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.600
Your mother

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.280
she had someone else.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.600
But in the end

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.960
she chose not to be with us.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.480
It was her choice.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.520
Not mine.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.040
But all of that

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.840
it was my fault.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.080
I gave too much of myself to work.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.000
And forgot about the ones behind me.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.920
Then why didn’t you tell me?

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.160
I didn’t want you to hate your mother.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Like I said

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.400
it was my fault.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.640
I drove her to that decision.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.320
So you carried all this pain alone?

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.720
See?

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.400
I told you being me isn’t easy.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.400
I’m sorry, Dad.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.120
If I had known

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.600
I would’ve understood you more.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.680
And I’m sorry to you too.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.720
I may not have been a good father.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.400
I kept thinking the only way

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.520
to keep you from hurting like I did

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.400
was for you to be strong.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.800
Give me a chance.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.880
I want to change.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.160
It may not happen right away.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.160
But I’ll try.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.920
Dad

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.560
I have something important to tell you.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.800

(Auction Result Announcement Day)

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.680
First, I’d like to thank everyone

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.720
for honoring us with your presence

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.960
as witnesses of

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.280
the auction result

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.600
for The Greater Duty Free today.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.960
The committee has carefully reviewed

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.239
the operational plans,

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:13.000
project models, and final proposals

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.520
from all participants.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:18.880
And the winner of The Greater Duty Free project

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.920
goes to

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.560
Orienna Group Company Limited.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.800
At the final meeting

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.920
I intended to leak our numbers

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.280
to Maevika.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.600
On behalf of The Greater’s committee

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.480
may I ask one question?

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.760
Since I already placed ten percent

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.280
- what benefits will we receive?
- Excuse me a moment.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.280
I understand.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.920
You probably think

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.720
the number we’re submitting

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.200
is too high, right?

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.680
But this figure

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.720
isn’t just about beating Superior

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.320
or any other competitors.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.120
It’s a declaration that

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.560
Orienna

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.280
is ready to run this concession.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.840
Therefore

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.320
thirty billion

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.400
is the most suitable figure.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.280
If they knew

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.760
they would’ve raised their number.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.720
Just like when we learned theirs.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.200
Therefore

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.880
we probably wouldn’t have won anyway.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.720
I’m sorry.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.080
But I don’t want to win by dirty means.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.880
I’ve made my decision, Dad.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.000
I’ll stick with the original number.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.720
Khun Mae, may I have an interview?

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.480
No interviews. No.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.480
- Khun Mae,
- Let me handle this.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.680
That’s enough.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.520
- Khun Ai,
- What made your company grow so big?

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.200
What’s going on?

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.320
Khun Mae!

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.120
Why didn’t you change the figure

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.200
so you could win?

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.960
I purposely

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.040
let you know Orienna’s number.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.400
What?

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.200
You mean

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.040
the phone call that day

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.960
you did it on purpose?

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.400
What kind of person are you really?

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.320
Playing dirty with me

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.800
right up to the last second?

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.760
I never thought of it as playing dirty.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.600
I did it because

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.360
I just felt guilty.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.000
For stealing secrets from you.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.200
I just wanted to make it right.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.120
Wouldn’t it have been easier

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.720
if you never started it at all?

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.080
And know this

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.200
Aiwarin.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.800
I

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.000
never gained anything from that bug.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.680
The only reason I kept it

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.560
was because I just wanted
to hear your voice.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.640
To feel like

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.400
you were close to me all the time.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.000
That’s all.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.120
Khun Ai, any words to share

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.400
on Orienna winning this bid?

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.720
As the leader of Orienna

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.200
I don’t see this win

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.120
as just our company’s victory.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.320
It’s also an opportunity

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.120
to create jobs.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.960
To build collaborations.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.480
To foster cooperation

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.080
among the new generation.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.040
with vision,

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.760
and ideas different
from the older generation.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.480
Who do you mean, Khun Ai?

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.080
Myself and Khun Maevika,

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.800
the leader of Superior.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.760
I hereby declare

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.000
that as Orienna,

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.400
the winner of this auction,

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.600
we invite Superior

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.520
to be our strategic partner,
(A strategic partner is someone you team up)

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:37.400
developing this concession together.
(with to create shared benefits, instead of competing against each other.)

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.000
But Khun Ai and Khun Mae

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.960
there were rumors of a secret deal.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.680
Won’t this raise questions
about your relationship again?

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.920
- That’s right.
- You’re not worried?

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.960
- Not afraid?
- No.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Will this be okay, Khun Ai?

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.200
I’m not afraid.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.200
Because no matter the questions

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.800
the answer remains the same.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.280
It isn’t true.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.600
What matters between Mae and me

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.040
comes from sincerity.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.480
There are no hidden benefits.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:18.280
(P’G)

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.080
Yes, P’G.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.320
Khun Mae.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.800
It’s me, Yam.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.720
The reason Khun Ai had to steal from you

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.720
was because her father ordered it.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.720
Khun Ai never wanted to betray you.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.200
She had to.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.520
Out of necessity.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.720
If she hadn’t

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.520
many others would’ve suffered.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.640
Khun Ai had no choice
and it hurt her deeply.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.200
Because she knew

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.880
what she did

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.440
was hurting the one she loved.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.880
If you love Khun Ai too

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.600
please talk to her with your heart.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.800
Not with anger.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.000
That way no one else will suffer from this.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.800
I hope I’ve helped them a little.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.760
I don’t know.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.440
Maybe this is all I can do.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.880
The rest is up to them.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.600
Why?

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.120
Why didn’t you ever tell me before

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.040
that you were forced
into so many things?

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.480
I didn’t see what good it would do.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.680
Because whether I was forced

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.080
or I chose to

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.120
I still did it.

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.320
So

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.000
what’s past, let it be past.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.600
Just let it go.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.400
Back when we were kids

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.400
you might not even remember.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.720
We once competed pitching ideas
for a school event.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.760
And you beat me.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.160
I was

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:00.880
so bitter about it.

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.160
And ever since then

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.720
I kept thinking that if I saw you again

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.000
I’d get my payback.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.800
And when I found out

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.840
I’d be competing against
you in the auction

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.280
I told myself right then,

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.200
this was it.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.920
This was my chance

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.480
to finally get back at you.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.680
I was going to beat you.

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.600
And I’d never lose to you again.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.280
But you know what?

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.800
But when I finally met you

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.480
I lost to you from day one.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.880
I love you, Aiwarin.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.000
I fell in love

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.200
with the one I was supposed to fight.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.200
Why wouldn’t I remember you?

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.200
I’ve been waiting for
the day to see you again too.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.720
All in favor of Aiwarin’s idea,
raise your hand.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.440
So, we’ll go with Aiwarin’s idea.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.200
Watch me.

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.160
If I get the chance,
I’ll get back at you.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.880
Hurry and do it.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:58.640
I’ll be waiting.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.120
To you

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.360
I may have been an enemy.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.520
But to me

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.360
you’re the only one in my heart.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.200
And maybe that’s why

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.200
I never dated anyone else.

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.800
If it wasn’t you.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.120
From now on

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.800
we don’t have to compete anymore.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.320
We’ll work together.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.960
I already announced to everyone

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.000
that I’ll invite Superior.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.120
to be our strategic partner.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.920
Thank you.

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.120
But

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.080
I don’t want success

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.520
that comes under someone else’s shadow.

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:55.000
I’d rather achieve it on my own.

00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.720
Don’t forget, though.

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:03.080
Even if this auction is over

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.600
Orienna and Superior

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.200
will still be rivals.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.040
So sooner or later

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.600
we may face off like this again.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.960
Hey, you.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.440
Sounds like

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.040
you’re breaking up with me again.

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.560
I’m sorry.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.000
It’s okay.

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.480
You can break up with me

00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.840
but I can’t break up with you.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.280
I’ll keep loving you the same.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.360
And no matter what happens

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.960
I’ll keep waiting for you.

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:22.080
Waiting for you to come back.

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.680
Yes, Khun Ai.

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:06.880
You.

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.280
Don’t overthink it.

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.920
Their decision

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.920
it won’t affect us.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.040
It does.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.600
Even if Khun Ai says
she understands Mae

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.000
she must be hurting.

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.800
And Mae must be hurting even more.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.960
If both of them are suffering

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.160
how can we allow ourselves happiness?

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.440
More importantly

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.440
from now on

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:46.000
they’ll each return to their duties.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.000
No one knows

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:50.600
if they’ll face each other again.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.800
What we must do

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.520
is support them fully.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.160
Think of it as

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.840
the little time we have together.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.640
Which honestly

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.000
isn’t much at all.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.640
So little that sometimes I wonder

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:26.040
if we even know each other well enough.

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.400
So

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.320
don’t be sad.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.160
You don’t need to tell me that.

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.200
how I should feel.

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.840
If you want to go

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.080
then go.

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.800
I’ll respect your decision.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.880
(Months later)

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.920
Don’t stress.

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:21.600
Just one more step
and you’ll succeed, Khun Mae.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.400
Keep that sweet smile on.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.640
Khun Mae, you’ve got a package.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.080
Today is your big day.

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.760
Use this pen.

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.720
I want you to know there’s still me

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.240
waiting to celebrate your success.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.920
How did you get in?

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.000
Did you forget?

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:42.080
I’ve got a Rose Gold card.

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.200
Why are you here?

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.320
I don’t know.

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.600
When I saw this pen

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.920
my heart told me

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.560
I had to come see you.

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.240
I’m sorry.

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.920
For making you wait
all alone for so long.

00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.120
Thank you.

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.600
For not letting it go on any longer.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.000
Thinking of someone?

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:01.800
Sitting here waiting?

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.760
Yeah, I am.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.800
But not you.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.480
Then who?

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.000
Just someone

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.920
who said I don’t know them well enough.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.600
Maybe they’re right.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.720
Maybe I don’t know them well enough.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.160
But I’ve seen sides
of them no one else has.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.600
And those sides made me fall for them.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.920
Is it this one?

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.000
Or this one?

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.280
Still not?

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.600
Then

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.400
it must be this one.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.880
Everyone!

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.920
Come on, let’s have some fun!

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.560
Come dance, come dance!

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.000
Hurry up!

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.600
I’m embarrassed. Let’s go back.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.280
Let’s get back together.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.320
Our bosses got back together too.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.400
I think this time they won’t part again.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.400
You think doing this

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.120
You think I’ll give in that easily?

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.520
Still not giving in?

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.720
Then

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.600
That’s enough. Let’s go back.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.200
You.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.680
Will you come back nicely?

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.000
I will.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.800
Back to the table.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.640
No.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.440
The first time we met

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.520
Khun Mae said

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.960
she’d get back at Khun Ai.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.280
Who would’ve believed

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.880
the rivals from that day

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:03.040
would become lovers today?

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.080
But before we got here

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.000
we had to go through so much together.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.360
Or maybe

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.600
when Khun Ai once said

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.200
fate always plays tricks on us,

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:24.080
maybe it was true.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.280
Fate’s part of it.

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.280
But what brought us here

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.080
isn’t just fate.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.880
It’s the hearts of the two of us.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.640
That

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.960
no matter how much time passes,

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.720
or what trials we face,

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.880
in the end

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.880
we’ll still choose to find our way back.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.680
I love you.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.520
I love you too.

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.560
(What happened to Khun Ai?)

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.840
Fight, girl! (Go girl!)

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.640
- She’s sweating.
- She didn’t take sugar, that’s why.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.240
LookMhee doesn’t take sugar.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.000
Get everyone hyped up.

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.760
(Mommy’s the dance queen)

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.720
- Cut!
- Cut!

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.880
(Knees gave out right there)

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.240
(Such sweet eyes, melting away)
Bear-eyes, more happiness.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:01.280
Hug, good job.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.720
(Super warm and cozy)
