00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.780
Good morning.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.850
Good morning.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.390
Good morning.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.440
Good morning.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.490
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.810
Tojo-san has been coming in pretty late
every day this week.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.010
He was just coming in too early before.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.750
Yeah.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.110
I guess... it must be my fault.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.000
I...

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.340
I don't even know who I am anymore.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.810
So...

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.800
Let's not see each other outside of work anymore.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.160
I can't... take this any further.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.160
Morning.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.450
Morning.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.620
Morning.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.120
I'm afraid that if things fall apart...

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.620
there'll be no going back.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.800
Sigh...

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.800
10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40
(Episode 11)

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.720
My girlfriend's been so cold to me.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.960
Yeah?

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.480
She said she's too busy to see me on the weekend.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.380
She's definitely avoiding me.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.020
And...

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.090
nothing has happened between us yet.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.760
She keeps turning me down.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.880
What should I do?

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.570
Why don't you just ask her?

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.640
Ask her directly.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.720
Ask her why she won't do it?

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.820
Yeah.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.350
If I had the guts to ask, I would have already.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.040
She probably feels the same way.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.280
"If I had the guts to say it, I would have already."

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.380
Maybe.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.860
If I'm direct with her and she runs off...

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.060
then you'll just have to give up.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.280
You could at least try to encourage me a little.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.680
I'm not in the mood.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.190
You're not...

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.920
still mad, are you?

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.240
Huh?

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.930
When I saw you with Tojo-san,

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.200
I just assumed you two were dating.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.710
Back then...

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.460
you seemed really mad.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.500
What do you mean, "seemed"?

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.650
You really don't know why?

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.800
I know I messed up.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.690
That's not good enough.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.880
Apologizing without even knowing the reason.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.400
I'm sorry.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.380
Oh.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.600
Uh...

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.110
When you've actually figured out why...

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.170
come and tell me then.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.160
Okay.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.220
Want some of this?

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.460
It's good.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.480
Alright, I'll leave the rest to you.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.330
Thanks.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.950
Okay.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.350
I'll be in touch by next week.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.370
Thank you.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.670
And say hi to Tojo-san for me.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.420
Will do.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.780
Ah.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.950
Keishi, are you busy on Saturday?

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.580
Uh, I don't have anything scheduled for work.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.340
How about we play squash then?

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.320
Uh...

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.790
Back when I was in Osaka,

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.420
didn't you used to play
with the guys from the volleyball club?

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.530
Not really...

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.470
But I haven't gone recently.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.170
Tsukahara and Teramoto said they're coming too.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.620
Oh.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.840
So? What do you say?

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.770
Yeah...

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.910
I'd like to go.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.220
Okay, I'll hit you up later.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.470
I can't say yes right away.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.380
- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.520
It seems I still...

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.450
can't give up on the idea...

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.650
of spending the weekend with Suzume-san.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.510
I don't feel like doing anything.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.190
It's been a while...

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.170
since I've had a weekend with no plans.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.860
I'm so bored.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.690
Suzuko.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.790
Ever since then...

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.050
I haven't heard Suzuko's voice.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.770
Come to think of it...

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.310
when I'm alone...

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.600
what do I usually do?

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.070
I'm hungry.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.600
Ouch... ah!

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.110
I haven't moved in so long, my body's so stiff.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.840
You say that...

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.670
but didn't you work out a lot in Osaka too?

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.960
I'm definitely not going easy on you.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.320
You've always been like this.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.270
Don't get all serious on me.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.300
No, but...

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.410
It's great that Keishi could make it.
It's been a while.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.730
Yeah.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:44.370
Mmm.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.830
Reuniting at a client's office.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.420
You two are really fated.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.590
Indeed.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.130
You were always inseparable back in school...

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.440
We just clicked.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.580
Right, Keishi?

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.230
Right.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.500
It's surprising you didn't see each other again
after graduation.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.160
No, that's because after Sakuma started dating the manager,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.710
he started ignoring Keishi, didn't he?

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.540
Hey, Keishi.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.460
You must have been lonely.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.080
I'm not a kid.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.320
No, that's not it...

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.600
Someone as popular as you...

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.130
probably doesn't get lonely.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.660
What kind of thing is that to say?

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.290
So dirty...

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.290
Let's get a new one.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.460
Buying a whole machine for something
you'll only use once.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.240
Huh? It's the exact opposite.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.730
Once you buy it...

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.380
you can use it as many times as you want.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.350
But we still only used it once.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.230
Speaking of which...

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.820
Oh...

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.050
Should we just use this to make something?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.870
Oh, good idea.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.490
But shouldn't we put it in right away?

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.510
- Okay.
- Keishi, squat down a bit more, you're out of the frame!

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.900
My bad.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:27.600
Sorry, sorry.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.030
Okay, let's take one.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.810
Okay, smile!

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.700
- Oh, this looks great.
- Send me the photo.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.050
AirDrop it to me.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:46.940
Whoa!

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.060
Nice shot!

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.490
Are you holding this?

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.480
- Got it.
- Okay.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.790
What is this?

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.320
Mmm.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:11.760
Mmm.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.520
Delicious.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:28.520
Mmm.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:29.890
Mmm.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.150
It's hot, isn't it?

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.110
I thought I was used to being alone.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.210
It's good.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.650
Delicious.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.400
About what we were talking about earlier...

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.720
Did you notice I was avoiding you?

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.660
I guess it couldn't be helped.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.610
But I regret it...

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.790
I really do.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.040
I regret how I acted back then.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.050
Even if I couldn't return your feelings...

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.010
I should have faced you properly.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.200
I shouldn't have run away.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.790
I was the one who ran away.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.620
Because I didn't want to get hurt.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.220
I was the one who chose to avoid it.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.440
So I guess that makes us even.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.710
Hiyah!

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.050
Talking about these old stories...

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.570
really shows how old we've gotten.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.120
You're right.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.440
We're such old guys now.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:27.780
Sakuma.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.040
If you're on a break, want to join us?

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.220
Oh.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.650
Sure, let's play.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.800
Take care, senpai.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.050
I'm off.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:38.680
Bring it on.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.040
You sure pick the weirdest times to call.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.390
Regret...

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.860
Tanaka-san?

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:55.860
Yes.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.130
I broke up with her.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.360
Did you have a proper talk with her?

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.450
I did.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.390
It was the only thing to do.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.010
You did?

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.550
Yeah.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.560
I'm sorry.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.840
The truth is...

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.310
I'm actually into girls.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.910
She said she's into girls.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.940
But...

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.170
If that's the case...

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.030
Then why did she go out with me?

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.540
Why say she liked me?

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:50.740
Why did she even kiss me?

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.020
I just don't get it at all.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:12:59.910
But then,

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.990
while I was so confused,

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.860
it finally dawned on me.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.560
I don't really understand anything at all.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.390
Keishi.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.150
The other day,

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.940
I acted like I knew everything.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.560
I'm really sorry.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.120
Well then,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.880
I guess I can forgive you.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.530
Thank you.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.520
It was a huge blow,

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.260
but...

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:57.570
I think I can

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.570
move on without any hard feelings.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.570
Tanaka-san.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.470
You really gave it your all.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.330
No, I didn't.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:12.220
Don't say that.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:15.900
No, for you to say that...

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.640
to my face...

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.100
(Sakuma: Playing squash with my old college volleyball friends.)

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.370
This is fine...

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.440
Hello?

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.190
The cake from the department store food court...

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.480
I bought it.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.220
Why?

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.150
The list...

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.090
It's not finished yet, is it?

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.410
I want to talk to you properly.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.930
That's all.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.150
I...

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.030
don't want to have any more regrets.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.840
This is the first time I've fallen for someone
I could imagine a future with.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:29.880
So,

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.600
I don't want anyone to ruin it.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.860
I was so happy when I was with you.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.050
Things like age or our positions...

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.870
I forgot all about them.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.800
I got carried away.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.660
Isn't that a good thing?

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.850
No, it's not!

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.200
If things continue like this,

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.250
everything you've worked so hard to build...

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.300
will be destroyed by me.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.860
That's why I can't do this.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.220
- I don't mind!
- I...

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:36.690
I'm the one who can't do it.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.080
I...

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.280
can't handle things as gracefully as you do.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:51.560
I can't get past it.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.070
I don't have the resolve to carry the weight of your future.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:07.780
Resolve...

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.180
What resolve...?

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.310
What are you talking about, resolve?

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.490
I don't need any resolve!

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.000
I just want to be with you, Suzume-san.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.500
Let's end it here.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.830
Suzume... Suzume-san!

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:03.550
Why...

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.810
Why do you always have to decide things on your own?

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.770
Is it because you're older?

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:14.870
Or because you're my boss?

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.730
What about the list?

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:28.300
What's going to happen to the list?

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.300
We were so close to finishing it.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:41.910
Just forget about it.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.000
The cake...

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:27.750
Make sure you eat it.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.020
Your place isn't here.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:29.780
I'm sorry.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.510
(Next time on...)
Even though you were ready to get serious, I...

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.170
Please don't run away.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.450
I want you, Suzume,

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.050
to be happy.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.410
I'm always selfishly...

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.510
thinking things like that.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.330
I am happy.
