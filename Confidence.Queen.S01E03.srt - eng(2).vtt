EPISODE 3

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:40.624
The operation will begin.
Is everyone ready?

00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:01.270
Ma'am, this way, please.
Watch your step there.

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:03.439
Congratulations.

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:04.940
I prepared what you wanted.

00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:06.901
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:08.152
Oh, how about a toast?

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.487
Yes, cheers.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.404
I love you all.

00:01:10.488 --> 00:01:11.530
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:01:11.614 --> 00:01:12.490
I love you.

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:16.285
Thank you so much again.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:18.621
I was able to manage through the year,
thanks to you, ma'am.

00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:20.247
-Thanks for your hard work.
-Goodness.

00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:21.165
Oh, don't mention it.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:24.502
By the way, is our next step
going to work, Yi-rang? Boss?

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:28.422
Don't worry. We have James.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.989
I'm counting on you, Yi-rang.

00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:30.104
Do you want to go somewhere quiet?

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:32.022
Where we can be alone?

00:05:22.114 --> 00:05:23.532
Oh, what's he saying?

00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:25.325
Gosh, that's so lame.

00:05:34.585 --> 00:05:36.336
Okay, I got his fingerprint.

00:05:37.713 --> 00:05:39.339
Just as I expected.

00:05:40.049 --> 00:05:42.551
What exactly were you expecting?

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:45.471
Well, what should I say?

00:05:45.888 --> 00:05:48.474
Fabulous, sophisticated,

00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:51.101
and luxurious.

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:54.021
And?

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.690
And excellent.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.364
I like that.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.376
We, Wonderby, will be purchasing

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.048
numerous works through you from now on.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:23.926
As you know,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.722
Wonderby Auction
is leading the global art scene.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.314
What can you offer me?

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.361
Tell me what you want, Olivia.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.571
I will find you anything you want.

00:06:44.655 --> 00:06:47.658
I'd do anything for you. Anything.

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:50.285
Really?

00:06:52.621 --> 00:06:53.497
What?

00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:55.666
Yi-rang, stop with that voice.

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:56.583
Hear me?

00:06:59.044 --> 00:06:59.878
Really?

00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:04.716
Olivia.

00:07:06.135 --> 00:07:11.807
I've handled masterpieces
far beyond anything you've ever seen.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:13.183
And...

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.395
would you believe me if I said

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.898
even bigger works have been created

00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:22.693
by my own hands?

00:07:36.123 --> 00:07:37.166
Mr…

00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:41.336
My apologies.
I didn't know you were with a guest.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.380
Well, the commission has been settled.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:45.632
Excuse me.

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:54.766
Well, Chairman Kim offered 50 million won.

00:07:57.269 --> 00:07:58.395
You may leave.

00:08:05.903 --> 00:08:07.196
-Olivia.
-Yes?

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:09.948
Will you look at that painting
for a second?

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:11.658
Oh my!

00:08:11.742 --> 00:08:12.784
One second.

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:34.806
I got the password!

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.183
Password secured.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.270
I'm going to be a waiter now.

00:08:41.313 --> 00:08:42.147
Let's do this.

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.573
-It's beautiful.
-It is.

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:54.826
What's wrong?

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.328
-What's wrong?
-I can't breathe.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:57.996
-Are you okay?
-I can't breathe.

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:00.082
It's suffocating.

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:03.669
You do look pale.
I think you're having cold sweats.

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:08.131
It's because I wore a tight dress
to impress someone today.

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:13.637
Whose favor?

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.517
Gosh, you're too much!

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.602
Naughty! Oh, seriously.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.731
Yes. I am, aren't I?

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:27.109
Here.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:28.318
Oh, Olivia.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:34.741
Do you want to go outside
for some fresh air?

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.411
Shall we?

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.164
Let's do that then. Be careful now.

00:09:41.665 --> 00:09:42.666
Follow me.

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:49.631
I feel lightheaded.

00:09:49.715 --> 00:09:52.551
Oh, boy. You should've told me.

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:55.304
I'm sorry. Be careful.

00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:29.254
The desk.

00:10:29.338 --> 00:10:31.006
Next to the desk?

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.592
Right. Behind the frame next to the desk.

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:34.885
Slide it, right?

00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:37.429
What…

00:10:50.484 --> 00:10:51.943
Do you still feel suffocated?

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:53.945
I feel much better.

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:55.989
I'm glad to hear that.

00:10:57.449 --> 00:11:01.286
By the way,
you've achieved enough in Korea.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.205
Don't you want to advance abroad?

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:06.166
I think I can help you with that.

00:11:07.084 --> 00:11:10.003
I still have things to do here.

00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:12.214
Perhaps,

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.716
it's the most important job

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:17.344
in an art critic's career.

00:11:18.387 --> 00:11:19.554
What could that be?

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:22.432
What is it?

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:25.394
Olivia is so curious!

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.401
Olivia,

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:35.487
if you ask me, I can't help but tell you.

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:39.825
Seriously, what is it?

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:41.368
I'm really curious.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.223
Discovering the van Gogh of Korea.

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:07.018
That's my life's dream.

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:10.147
You want to discover
Korea's Vincent van Gogh?

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.398
Discovering an unknown painter,

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:14.359
who was so obsessed with art
that they devoted their entire life to it

00:12:14.443 --> 00:12:15.944
and died without a name.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.822
It's a noble calling
that gives their work a second life.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.161
I believe that it's worth
dedicating my life to.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:25.996
Seriously, cut the crap.

00:12:26.872 --> 00:12:28.290
I'm touched.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:31.918
Not only is your insight remarkable.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.171
So are you.

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:40.719
Gosh, you flatter me.

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:47.767
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop myself.

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:49.978
I should've held back.

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:53.565
Oh, wait. You got some…

00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:58.570
Olivia.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.117
Holding back will make you sick.

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:06.286
Don't hold back.

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:26.890
What's that?

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:30.352
Security! Run to my office! Hurry!

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:31.770
Yes, sir.

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:34.189
Make some noise!

00:13:38.944 --> 00:13:41.863
Make some noise!

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:43.865
Jump!

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.785
-James, buy me more time.
-What?

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.078
I can't hear you.

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.371
What? Stop them?

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.373
Where are they?

00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:53.667
Got it.

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:57.045
To the right!

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.926
Jump!

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:06.179
Jump higher!

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.188
Damn it.

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:38.878
What the…

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:53.310
Something wrong?

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:05.280
CHEONMYEONG SHOP

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:06.698
3 MONTHS AGO

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:07.907
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:10.035
One second. It's Gu-ho.

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:11.536
Gu-ho, when will you be back?

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.330
You said you'd toast marshmallows for us.

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:15.457
I'm getting tired of waiting for you.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.666
Gu-ho, hurry up.

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:19.044
I promise I'll visit you soon.

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:22.130
I shouldn't have called you
when you were busy.

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:25.050
Are you ill, by the way?
You don't sound good.

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:27.260
No, I'm not ill.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:32.057
She used to call me every day,
but I haven't been able to reach her.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.725
She's never done that before.

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:37.228
It's probably nothing.
I will visit her later.

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:40.231
If you could do that for me,
I'd really appreciate it.

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:41.358
All right.

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:50.533
So, did you all get what you want?
What are you having?

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.869
GYEONGJEON OFFICETEL, UNIT 602

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:54.788
Gyeongjeon Officetel.

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:55.789
GYEONGJEON OFFICETEL

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:56.706
Okay.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:14.265
Bo-ra.

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:16.810
Bo-ra.

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:15.285
Bo-ra?

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:19.080
Bo-ra?

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:20.623
Bo-ra?

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:24.085
No!

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.225
Hey, are you okay?

00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:51.112
He's here to see you.
Don't you want to see his face?

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:58.578
Say something, Bo-ra, will you?

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:07.337
Ma'am, I will go and get what Bo-ra needs.

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:09.297
Will you do that for me?

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.591
I think I should stay by her side.

00:18:11.674 --> 00:18:12.509
Sure.

00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:38.409
MY SECRET WEAPON IS STILL IN MY HANDS
THAT IS HOPE

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:40.286
IN EVERYONE'S HEART
THERE IS A JEWEL OF THOUGHT

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.872
AFTER THE INTERNSHIP
IT'S THE EXHIBITION!

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:44.165
ONE DAY, I'M GOING TO SHINE

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:19.409
He called me to his office again.

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:22.662
He fondled and touched me again.

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:31.129
When I try to avoid him,
he talks about my debut.

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:38.553
TREASURE HUNT

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:42.307
Then, today, will we get to see
an authentic masterpiece?

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.935
Let's bring in today's client.
Please come out.

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.531
It's Legall's work.

00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:02.660
My mother purchased it
from an art gallery in Paris 25 years ago.

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:04.829
I have a certificate of authenticity too.

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:07.457
May I take a look?

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.374
Yes.

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:15.256
Thank you.

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:16.549
Sure.

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:20.929
Let me take a look at the painting
for a moment.

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:29.729
May I ask the purchase price?

00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:33.775
My mother said
she paid 12 million won at the time…

00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:37.528
After the IMF crisis,

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:39.906
when the country's economy
was back on the right track,

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:44.869
many malicious painting sellers abroad
took advantage of many Korean tourists.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.621
I see.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.375
Your mother was one of them.

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:52.710
What?

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.464
Wait, then are you saying
this is counterfeit?

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:58.383
No.

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:01.928
It's worse than that.

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:03.471
What?

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:06.391
The painting material, the brushstrokes,
and even the composition…

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:07.558
Everything's terrible.

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:11.270
This doesn't do Legall any justice.
It's pure disrespect.

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:13.272
Wait, that can't be true.

00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:14.607
Can you take a look again?

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:15.733
Look.

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:18.569
None of Legall's paintings
ever used a canvas

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:21.489
that contained fluorescent materials.

00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:25.952
It is clearly a cheap forgery.

00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:29.872
-But…
-This is not Legall's painting.

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:31.749
But how can you…

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:35.503
Wait, are you saying
it's not even worth a little?

00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:37.463
I will not comfort you with lame excuses.

00:21:41.342 --> 00:21:43.678
But my mom is watching.

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:46.139
Remember.

00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:52.478
True class is defined by the eyes
that can see what's real.

00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:57.608
He's now on public TV? He's thriving.

00:21:58.026 --> 00:22:00.445
Mr. Famous is famous these days.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:03.156
An art critic well-versed
in all forms of artistic expression

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:05.116
and a major player
in the art business world.

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:07.785
His jawline is just sharp enough
to look masculine.

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:10.038
A nose that brings balance to his face.

00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:12.540
And slightly slanted eyes.

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:15.626
He has the fennec fox face.
That's the trend these days.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:16.836
He's my type.

00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:19.505
Why did you turn it off? Are you jealous?

00:22:19.589 --> 00:22:21.049
Jealous? Me? No!

00:22:21.132 --> 00:22:22.508
He's darn ugly.

00:22:22.925 --> 00:22:24.177
Why is he sulking again?

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.595
I mean…

00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:27.889
Seriously, because of him, Bo-ra is…

00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:29.182
Bo-ra? Like the color purple?

00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:31.642
Remember the shop by the beach?

00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:33.770
Oh, the one that also runs an inn?

00:22:33.853 --> 00:22:36.022
Bo-ra is the daughter of the inn's owner.

00:22:36.105 --> 00:22:37.231
So?

00:22:37.315 --> 00:22:39.817
What happened
between Purple and Mr. Famous?

00:22:42.737 --> 00:22:44.989
Bo-ra met Mr. Famous six months ago.

00:22:45.073 --> 00:22:48.284
Mr. Famous visited her university
as a guest instructor.

00:22:48.826 --> 00:22:52.914
A familiar motif and an imitated touch.

00:22:53.623 --> 00:22:54.707
That is just…

00:23:00.505 --> 00:23:02.256
You've got the artistic sense though.

00:23:03.716 --> 00:23:04.634
Not bad.

00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:10.098
If you have anything else,
bring it to my gallery.

00:23:11.766 --> 00:23:12.600
What?

00:23:16.813 --> 00:23:22.026
Bo-ra was naive enough
to trust his word and visit that jerk.

00:23:22.985 --> 00:23:26.781
A RUTHLESS MAN KNOWS WHAT'S REAL

00:23:35.373 --> 00:23:36.624
You're here, Bo-ra.

00:23:36.707 --> 00:23:37.750
It's me.

00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:42.713
Let me see how much you've improved
since the last time.

00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:47.760
Not bad.

00:23:48.636 --> 00:23:51.139
You've gotten better from last time.

00:23:52.014 --> 00:23:52.932
Really?

00:23:56.811 --> 00:23:57.979
You're improving every day.

00:24:01.524 --> 00:24:03.151
I think it makes sense.

00:24:03.234 --> 00:24:06.863
He's a good-looking professor
giving her warm support during his visit.

00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:09.198
And they're both artists.

00:24:09.282 --> 00:24:11.450
He had the power to help her debut too.
Don't you think?

00:24:11.534 --> 00:24:12.743
No.

00:24:12.827 --> 00:24:15.413
To students like Bo-ra,
Mr. Famous is like god.

00:24:15.496 --> 00:24:17.540
He's just a piece of trash

00:24:17.623 --> 00:24:21.794
who takes advantage of his status
to go after women.

00:24:21.878 --> 00:24:23.963
Mr. Famous was actually known for that.

00:24:24.046 --> 00:24:25.298
There were scandals and lawsuits.

00:24:25.381 --> 00:24:27.258
And his girlfriends kept changing.

00:24:27.884 --> 00:24:28.885
Because he's attractive.

00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:30.344
What a piece of trash.

00:24:30.428 --> 00:24:31.262
All right.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.058
Now, shall we get started?

00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:37.727
-Start what?
-What?

00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:41.647
What do you mean "what"?
Mr. Famous is good laundry material.

00:24:41.731 --> 00:24:44.483
We can't just ignore the jerk
who did that to Bo-ra.

00:24:44.567 --> 00:24:45.651
I'll sit this one out.

00:24:46.027 --> 00:24:46.903
Why?

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.491
It's too little.
I'm not interested in pocket money.

00:24:55.119 --> 00:24:56.495
James.

00:24:57.538 --> 00:24:58.873
You can't do this to me.

00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:03.085
When you passed out,
though you were faking it,

00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:04.670
I swore to take revenge for you.

00:25:04.754 --> 00:25:06.380
-Remember?
-I remember.

00:25:06.464 --> 00:25:08.549
Money's not everything, James.

00:25:08.633 --> 00:25:10.134
Money is the essence of life.

00:25:11.469 --> 00:25:12.386
Stay out of it.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:13.930
James, help me.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.101
You're right.

00:25:19.185 --> 00:25:22.021
Money is the essence of life,
but it's not everything.

00:25:22.104 --> 00:25:24.232
It's not, but it's about 90%.

00:25:24.315 --> 00:25:25.233
James.

00:25:25.316 --> 00:25:28.069
From now on,
you're the boss of this operation.

00:25:30.947 --> 00:25:32.782
I will do anything you say, James.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.118
-That's not bad.
-Right?

00:25:36.202 --> 00:25:38.955
I mean, what can't we do
without Yi-rang? Right?

00:25:39.038 --> 00:25:39.872
This prick…

00:25:39.956 --> 00:25:42.083
Right, for something this size,
the two of us will do.

00:25:42.667 --> 00:25:44.669
And it's something I always do.

00:25:44.752 --> 00:25:47.421
That's right.
You're an expert in this field.

00:25:48.256 --> 00:25:50.007
Let me see.

00:25:52.051 --> 00:25:53.886
Given his complex relationships
with women,

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.514
in just a day or two,
we'll be able to spot his weakness.

00:25:56.597 --> 00:25:58.349
We'll pay Purple compensation with that,

00:25:58.432 --> 00:26:01.394
and the two of us
can take some commission.

00:26:01.477 --> 00:26:02.853
You can have my share.

00:26:02.937 --> 00:26:05.773
I can sacrifice that much
to serve such a great boss like you.

00:26:05.856 --> 00:26:07.066
We have a chance.

00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:08.401
I'm in!

00:26:09.026 --> 00:26:10.278
So now…

00:26:10.695 --> 00:26:11.570
Scalpel.

00:26:12.405 --> 00:26:14.865
-We'll dig up Mr. Famous's dirt.
-Suction!

00:26:14.949 --> 00:26:16.659
To bits and pieces, every single detail,

00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:18.411
completely, all of it, and everything!

00:26:18.494 --> 00:26:19.912
-Yes, Boss!
-Louder!

00:26:19.996 --> 00:26:21.122
Yes, Boss!

00:26:21.205 --> 00:26:23.624
-Let's get it!
-Okay, let's get it!

00:26:24.875 --> 00:26:26.294
Another unit of blood, please.

00:26:39.515 --> 00:26:42.310
WASH & HAPPY
LAUNDRY SERVICE

00:26:43.311 --> 00:26:44.395
Excuse me.

00:26:44.895 --> 00:26:46.647
We're here for the fire inspection.

00:26:47.481 --> 00:26:48.524
What? Inspect what?

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:49.567
Fire inspection.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:50.901
I don't want any noise. Get out.

00:26:50.985 --> 00:26:53.362
I'm sorry, but noise can't be avoided.

00:26:56.157 --> 00:26:58.075
For Christ's sake.

00:26:58.159 --> 00:27:01.162
-What about the VIP invitation list?
-Oh, the final…

00:27:01.746 --> 00:27:02.913
MS. NA

00:27:04.582 --> 00:27:05.416
Yes? Jeez.

00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:09.754
One moment, please.
Sorry, it's too loud in here.

00:27:16.052 --> 00:27:16.886
Hold there.

00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:19.263
Yes. The complimentary item?

00:27:19.347 --> 00:27:20.931
Yes, I made sure you got one.

00:27:34.278 --> 00:27:35.529
Gu-ho, can you see clearly?

00:27:35.613 --> 00:27:37.448
Mr. Famous's house is above his office.

00:27:39.075 --> 00:27:39.909
It's your turn now.

00:27:47.458 --> 00:27:49.085
-I'm here for disinfection.
-Okay.

00:27:49.168 --> 00:27:50.127
-Where?
-That way, please.

00:27:50.211 --> 00:27:51.754
Over there? Thank you.

00:28:09.105 --> 00:28:10.606
-My goodness.
-Can you see me?

00:28:11.148 --> 00:28:13.567
Yes, I can see you very well.
Very good-looking.

00:28:20.241 --> 00:28:23.744
Now, shall we uncover
the truth about Mr. Famous?

00:28:30.793 --> 00:28:34.004
It's only a matter of time
until we catch this guy's weakness.

00:28:53.023 --> 00:28:54.442
James, wait.

00:28:55.776 --> 00:28:57.945
I think he's looking straight into it.

00:28:59.029 --> 00:29:00.448
Did we get caught?

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:13.544
No, wait.

00:29:14.128 --> 00:29:15.588
His eyes aren't looking here.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.340
It's about 0.8 degrees off.

00:29:20.968 --> 00:29:21.802
What?

00:29:25.055 --> 00:29:27.308
Jeez, it's tilted.

00:29:27.391 --> 00:29:28.809
-Jeez.
-That's right.

00:29:29.477 --> 00:29:32.188
That scared me.
Wait, how did you even catch that?

00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:33.481
I'm an expert.

00:29:33.564 --> 00:29:37.026
Gosh, I thought
he was looking straight at me.

00:29:37.109 --> 00:29:38.486
He's a little cross-eyed.

00:29:38.569 --> 00:29:39.528
-His eyes?
-Yes.

00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:46.827
Mr. Famous, good job!

00:29:47.453 --> 00:29:48.829
You're awesome.

00:29:49.497 --> 00:29:52.458
Make sure to be born as yourself again
in your next life.

00:29:53.375 --> 00:29:54.376
Hey.

00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:56.170
You're doing great.

00:29:58.714 --> 00:29:59.924
Oh, so nice.

00:30:01.634 --> 00:30:03.052
-What a loser.
-What a loser.

00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.657
That's laughable.

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.283
It's the size of a candle.

00:30:26.367 --> 00:30:27.368
I'm rooting for you.

00:30:34.083 --> 00:30:36.669
Ew, that disgusting punk. So gross.

00:30:36.752 --> 00:30:37.795
So freaking gross.

00:30:37.878 --> 00:30:39.630
Even my poo looks cute.

00:30:40.589 --> 00:30:42.466
I mean, how does one even say that?

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.093
He just made me imagine it.

00:30:44.176 --> 00:30:46.345
Stop saying nonsense, you poophead.

00:30:54.061 --> 00:30:55.104
I'm bored.

00:30:56.647 --> 00:30:58.023
Going over.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:02.778
Yes!

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:04.780
Step on it! Come on!

00:31:06.615 --> 00:31:08.075
This is boring.

00:31:11.996 --> 00:31:13.038
It's boring.

00:31:18.252 --> 00:31:21.171
ART CRITIC 'S ENDLESS PASSION
WRITTEN BY MR. FAMOUS

00:31:25.551 --> 00:31:26.385
Okay.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.764
All right. Let's find out who he is.

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:37.062
He studied aesthetics
at Hongmin University

00:31:37.146 --> 00:31:39.315
and earned his master's
and doctoral degrees there too.

00:31:39.398 --> 00:31:42.401
He received the Curator of the Year Award
for his sharp criticism abilities.

00:31:43.402 --> 00:31:45.279
Thanks to a corporation's sponsorship,

00:31:45.362 --> 00:31:47.823
he started running his own gallery
at a young age.

00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:52.036
After discovering a few
missing masterpieces by famous painters,

00:31:52.119 --> 00:31:54.705
he instantly became a star critic.

00:32:01.045 --> 00:32:01.879
MR. FAMOUS' ART CLASS

00:32:01.962 --> 00:32:03.255
MR. FAMOUS' MUSEUM RECOMMENDATIONS

00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:09.553
YOUNG CRITIC DISCOVERS YU KANG-IL'S PIECE

00:32:15.601 --> 00:32:17.895
Yes, it was this painting.

00:32:28.155 --> 00:32:30.449
So is it real or not?

00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:35.996
Ma'am, I am sorry.

00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:39.667
It's one of the mass-produced pieces
from the early '90s.

00:32:40.793 --> 00:32:41.710
This is a forgery.

00:32:43.003 --> 00:32:44.630
Darn it.

00:32:44.713 --> 00:32:46.799
And they talked like I owed them a lot.

00:32:47.257 --> 00:32:50.386
Still, the finish is pretty good.

00:32:50.469 --> 00:32:52.179
I'll buy it for 250,000…

00:32:53.639 --> 00:32:56.517
I'll buy it for 300,000 won. Yes, 300,000.

00:32:57.559 --> 00:32:58.394
I will buy it.

00:33:00.562 --> 00:33:04.274
He lies that a genuine painting is
a forgery and buys it dirt cheap?

00:33:04.358 --> 00:33:06.360
How much is he going to sell it for?

00:33:08.195 --> 00:33:09.988
I'm thinking 30 million won.

00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:14.326
What the…

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.121
Turning 300,000 into 30 million?
Ridiculous!

00:33:17.204 --> 00:33:20.124
That's insane. He's a total fraud.

00:33:20.207 --> 00:33:21.291
A darn fraud.

00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:29.758
I was having a meal.

00:33:30.843 --> 00:33:32.845
Hello, ma'am.

00:33:34.263 --> 00:33:35.639
Yes. It's me, Mr. Famous.

00:33:35.723 --> 00:33:38.058
Yes, of course. I got a big one for you.

00:33:39.393 --> 00:33:41.562
James, wake up.

00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:42.813
What's going on?

00:33:43.188 --> 00:33:44.022
Listen to this.

00:33:44.648 --> 00:33:46.942
-When I saw the altar painting…
-It's cold.

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:50.696
…I immediately thought of you
and your deep faith in Buddhism.

00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:52.406
Yes, of course.

00:33:53.073 --> 00:33:55.242
Ma'am, do you know King Jinheung?

00:33:55.325 --> 00:33:57.995
During the rebuilding period
in the time of King Jinheung of Silla,

00:33:58.078 --> 00:33:59.496
it was stored at a temple.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.207
I don't even need to mention its value.

00:34:03.834 --> 00:34:06.044
Of course. I won't say a word about it.

00:34:06.712 --> 00:34:09.214
As always. Without any trouble.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.384
Illegal purchase and trade
of cultural heritage?

00:34:12.468 --> 00:34:15.053
Gosh, this is getting serious, right?

00:34:15.137 --> 00:34:16.430
-I know, right?
-Yes.

00:34:16.513 --> 00:34:18.849
For something this big,
shouldn't we call Yi-rang?

00:34:18.932 --> 00:34:19.892
No!

00:34:19.975 --> 00:34:22.561
You're the boss, James.

00:34:22.644 --> 00:34:24.938
I know you can do it!

00:34:25.022 --> 00:34:27.649
Your boss had a plan,

00:34:27.733 --> 00:34:29.485
but this is getting out of control.

00:34:29.568 --> 00:34:32.321
No. You can still do it, James.

00:34:32.404 --> 00:34:34.156
-I can do it.
-Yes, you have a plan.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:35.866
-I can do it.
-You can do it, Boss!

00:34:38.243 --> 00:34:39.161
I can do it!

00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:41.288
-You're the boss!
-I can do it!

00:34:41.371 --> 00:34:43.624
WASH & HAPPY
LAUNDRY SERVICE

00:34:54.384 --> 00:34:56.094
I told you to eat well.

00:34:56.178 --> 00:34:57.012
-What is…
-What's this?

00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:58.096
Sushi?

00:34:59.556 --> 00:35:01.683
What are you doing here at this hour?

00:35:01.767 --> 00:35:03.435
Never mind. It's the morning.

00:35:03.519 --> 00:35:06.104
Are you here
because you were bored without us?

00:35:06.188 --> 00:35:08.774
Bored? Me? Why would I be?

00:35:08.857 --> 00:35:11.568
No way.
Yi-rang can have fun all by herself.

00:35:12.653 --> 00:35:14.071
I guess you're not happy to see me.

00:35:15.113 --> 00:35:17.533
Come on. You know he's happy to see you.

00:35:17.616 --> 00:35:18.534
Tell her.

00:35:19.201 --> 00:35:22.371
Well, then are we doing this together now?

00:35:23.914 --> 00:35:24.748
Why would I?

00:35:25.249 --> 00:35:28.001
What do you mean "why"?
Because we're a team.

00:35:29.419 --> 00:35:31.505
Yi-rang's the only one
who cares about us, right?

00:35:39.388 --> 00:35:40.722
What's all this?

00:35:40.806 --> 00:35:42.558
Producing forgeries…

00:35:43.475 --> 00:35:45.853
Illegal trade of cultural heritage?

00:35:47.354 --> 00:35:49.147
He wasn't some small laundry.

00:35:49.231 --> 00:35:50.816
He turned out to be huge.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.402
-Is that so?
-Yes.

00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:54.319
Yes.

00:35:56.905 --> 00:35:58.407
CHAIRMAN KIM OF HUNDRED VICTORIES GROUP

00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:08.625
Yes, sir.

00:36:08.709 --> 00:36:11.420
Mr. Famous helps
politicians and high-ranking officials

00:36:11.503 --> 00:36:13.422
build illegal slush funds through art.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:18.594
His phone is set to ring
anytime his VVIP clients call.

00:36:20.012 --> 00:36:21.346
So, when the phone rings,

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:25.601
he answers it anytime, day or night,
mid-meeting or fast asleep.

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:31.523
The genuine piece will be stored safely
in the basement storage.

00:36:33.609 --> 00:36:35.360
If one buys a painting
with the company's funds,

00:36:35.444 --> 00:36:38.488
Mr. Famous produces
an identical fake piece.

00:36:38.989 --> 00:36:41.199
Then the forgery is hung
on the company lobby,

00:36:41.283 --> 00:36:42.409
-and the genuine work…
-Thanks.

00:36:42.492 --> 00:36:44.578
…is used to build
the chairman's illegal slush funds.

00:36:44.661 --> 00:36:45.871
He's even making a deal

00:36:45.954 --> 00:36:48.165
with the chairman
of Hundred Victories Group?

00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:49.958
That's not the end of it.

00:36:50.042 --> 00:36:53.128
I bet there are tons of rich people
involved with Mr. Famous.

00:36:53.879 --> 00:36:56.048
This might be more complex
than we thought.

00:36:56.798 --> 00:36:58.675
This might be worth money.

00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:00.802
What? Are you saying…

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.765
Can I expand the scale?

00:37:04.848 --> 00:37:07.559
Yes, of course. It can't hurt.

00:37:07.643 --> 00:37:09.561
So are you in too?

00:37:09.645 --> 00:37:11.063
No takebacks. Okay?

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:13.482
But there's something I need to do first.

00:37:13.565 --> 00:37:14.524
What is it?

00:37:17.152 --> 00:37:20.072
-Reordering the hierarchy.
-Reordering the hierarchy?

00:37:21.782 --> 00:37:23.033
Call me "Boss."

00:37:24.034 --> 00:37:24.993
Boss.

00:37:25.077 --> 00:37:26.495
Why aren't you saying it?

00:37:27.663 --> 00:37:28.705
I'm leaving then.

00:37:28.789 --> 00:37:30.666
-Fine, Boss.
-Boss.

00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:32.292
Happy now, Boss?

00:37:34.127 --> 00:37:34.962
Yes.

00:37:35.379 --> 00:37:39.007
Now, why don't you come up
with a strategy, Boss?

00:37:41.218 --> 00:37:43.679
Your face says
you already have something in mind.

00:37:44.388 --> 00:37:45.931
What we need right now is…

00:37:46.014 --> 00:37:47.057
Is?

00:37:48.809 --> 00:37:50.894
…the perfect pushover.

00:38:02.572 --> 00:38:04.783
"Your Eyes, Nose, And Lips"
by Painter Go Hui-jeong.

00:38:04.866 --> 00:38:06.576
We'll start at 40 million.

00:38:07.536 --> 00:38:08.453
Forty million.

00:38:09.621 --> 00:38:10.747
Forty-one million.

00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:12.624
Forty-three million.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.887
The next work
is Painter Kim Gi-baek's "Frozen Time."

00:38:25.971 --> 00:38:27.639
The single unforgettable moment…

00:38:31.435 --> 00:38:32.978
moment in life.

00:38:37.232 --> 00:38:41.862
It's a work that expresses such memory
in a dreamy way.

00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:51.079
Kim Gi-baek's "Frozen Time."

00:38:51.163 --> 00:38:54.041
The bid starts from 50 million.

00:38:56.043 --> 00:38:58.211
Fifty million. Fifty-five million.

00:38:58.545 --> 00:38:59.379
Sixty million.

00:38:59.463 --> 00:39:00.422
Sixty-five million!

00:39:00.881 --> 00:39:01.715
Eighty million.

00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:08.555
We have 80 million won.

00:39:09.264 --> 00:39:10.474
Eighty million won.

00:39:11.391 --> 00:39:12.517
Sold.

00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:19.524
Next artwork.

00:39:19.608 --> 00:39:20.484
LOT 23
KANG JI-HYUNG

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.943
Sixty million.

00:39:22.235 --> 00:39:23.570
Sixty million won!

00:39:23.653 --> 00:39:25.697
Sixty million won. Sold.

00:39:25.781 --> 00:39:26.615
Ninety million.

00:39:26.698 --> 00:39:28.200
Ninety million. Sold.

00:39:28.283 --> 00:39:29.743
-One hundred and fifty million.
-Sold.

00:39:31.495 --> 00:39:32.662
It's sold.

00:39:40.295 --> 00:39:43.256
The paintings you purchased
will be safely delivered to your house.

00:39:44.674 --> 00:39:46.426
Be careful. Treat them like babies.

00:39:47.427 --> 00:39:48.512
I appreciate it.

00:39:48.595 --> 00:39:52.516
As I heard, there were many great works,
Mr. Famous.

00:39:52.599 --> 00:39:53.517
Thank you.

00:39:54.476 --> 00:39:55.727
Oh, right.

00:39:57.938 --> 00:40:00.148
I'm the Head of Purchasing
for Wonderby Asia,

00:40:00.232 --> 00:40:01.775
Olivia Kim.

00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:06.780
By Wonderby, you mean
the world's biggest auction company?

00:40:06.863 --> 00:40:07.697
It is that Wonderby.

00:40:17.707 --> 00:40:20.043
Wait.

00:40:20.961 --> 00:40:23.922
You purchased so many pieces today.

00:40:24.005 --> 00:40:25.674
If you don't mind,

00:40:25.757 --> 00:40:28.301
I'd like to return the favor.

00:40:29.052 --> 00:40:30.720
Can we have dinner together?

00:40:30.804 --> 00:40:33.682
I understand
if you already have plans, though.

00:40:35.976 --> 00:40:37.227
You read my mind.

00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:48.029
Have you heard the news that

00:40:48.113 --> 00:40:51.825
Wonderby's headquarters
sold all shares of Soul Auction?

00:40:51.908 --> 00:40:52.826
Yes.

00:40:53.535 --> 00:40:55.704
That's the biggest issue
in the field lately.

00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:56.997
Of course I've heard about it.

00:40:57.455 --> 00:41:03.628
We're expecting Korea to reshape
the Asian art world in the next ten years.

00:41:03.712 --> 00:41:05.505
That is our anticipation,

00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:09.384
that the Korean wave in diverse fields
will not wither easily.

00:41:10.844 --> 00:41:11.928
I wasn't aware

00:41:12.554 --> 00:41:15.974
of Wonderby's thoughts
on the art world in Korea.

00:41:18.977 --> 00:41:20.729
To tell you the truth,

00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:23.773
it is not an anticipation but a plan.

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:30.780
Our decision sets trends
in the global art scene.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.491
Obviously,

00:41:33.575 --> 00:41:37.162
as Wonderby is leading the world trend.

00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:44.836
SOUL AUCTION
LEGAL TEAM MANAGER CHOI DAE-CHEOL

00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:46.338
Right.

00:41:47.005 --> 00:41:50.467
You must have met
Soul Auction's legal team manager.

00:41:51.635 --> 00:41:52.636
His name is…

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.347
Choi…

00:41:56.473 --> 00:41:57.432
Right.

00:41:57.849 --> 00:41:59.392
I've got his business card here.

00:42:02.145 --> 00:42:03.271
Buy some time.

00:42:04.314 --> 00:42:05.148
Hurry.

00:42:22.415 --> 00:42:24.501
LEGAL TEAM MANAGER CHOI DAE-CHEOL

00:42:24.584 --> 00:42:25.961
-Choi Dae-cheol!
-Choi Dae-cheol!

00:42:27.754 --> 00:42:29.214
-Jeez!
-What's up?

00:42:29.297 --> 00:42:32.175
-Ouch.
-What…

00:42:33.677 --> 00:42:35.387
I've been suffering from rhinitis.

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:37.973
Choi Dae-cheol, right? Mr. Choi.

00:42:39.975 --> 00:42:42.269
Oh, I finally remembered.

00:42:42.352 --> 00:42:44.521
I've been getting forgetful these days.

00:43:10.046 --> 00:43:11.381
Jeez!

00:43:11.464 --> 00:43:12.465
I'm sorry.

00:43:13.008 --> 00:43:14.259
What's wrong? What happened?

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.222
Excuse me. I need to make a call.

00:43:28.398 --> 00:43:29.774
Yi-rang,

00:43:29.858 --> 00:43:31.943
did you do something weird?

00:43:32.652 --> 00:43:33.737
I didn't do anything.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.739
Yi-rang. Please, I'm begging you.

00:43:35.822 --> 00:43:39.659
Don't act on everything
that pops into your head, please.

00:43:39.784 --> 00:43:41.995
I respect all your ideas,
but not this time.

00:43:42.078 --> 00:43:43.496
No improvising. Stick to the script.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.414
Stick to the script.

00:43:44.497 --> 00:43:47.667
Why do you all think I can't do it?

00:43:47.751 --> 00:43:49.461
I can pull it off too.

00:43:49.544 --> 00:43:50.670
That was really close.

00:43:50.754 --> 00:43:51.671
-It was.
-Yes.

00:43:51.755 --> 00:43:53.423
Whatever. And don't yell.

00:43:54.424 --> 00:43:56.801
Is he puking or what?
What's taking him so long?

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:14.444
May I ask when you arrived in Korea?

00:44:20.617 --> 00:44:21.785
Two days ago.

00:44:22.494 --> 00:44:24.704
Why do you ask?

00:44:31.961 --> 00:44:35.006
I'm just worried that you might be tired.

00:44:36.216 --> 00:44:37.217
I see.

00:44:38.176 --> 00:44:39.511
I stopped by Hong Kong.

00:44:39.594 --> 00:44:43.056
And yesterday's meeting with Soul Auction
was the last on my official schedule.

00:44:43.139 --> 00:44:45.266
You could say

00:44:45.892 --> 00:44:48.144
I'm on a short break now.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.441
Hello, sir.

00:44:53.525 --> 00:44:56.152
The name of the person
in charge of Asia is indeed Olivia Kim.

00:44:56.236 --> 00:44:58.029
She arrived in Korea two days ago,

00:44:58.113 --> 00:45:00.365
and she's currently
on a business trip around Asia.

00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:09.124
You are truly amazing.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.626
Pardon?

00:45:14.254 --> 00:45:17.340
At Wonderby, which holds sway
over the global art world,

00:45:17.424 --> 00:45:18.925
you're in charge of Asia,

00:45:19.008 --> 00:45:21.511
the region destined to become
the most influential.

00:45:26.599 --> 00:45:27.892
I was just lucky.

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:32.147
Meeting people in various fields
around the world,

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:35.024
I'm humbled by their passion and insight.

00:45:35.108 --> 00:45:37.402
Especially when I meet someone

00:45:37.485 --> 00:45:40.697
with such a unique insight like yours.

00:45:43.867 --> 00:45:46.077
Oh, my heart is pounding.

00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:49.706
Do you see I'm getting a little shy?

00:45:54.419 --> 00:45:55.670
If that is you being shy,

00:45:55.753 --> 00:45:59.090
I can't wait to see
what you're like when you're bold.

00:45:59.591 --> 00:46:01.176
You will soon see it

00:46:01.551 --> 00:46:03.887
because I will show you.

00:46:17.984 --> 00:46:22.155
I didn't expect to have such a good time
before going back to England.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.991
When are you going back?

00:46:26.451 --> 00:46:30.121
Well, if there's nothing special,
I might go back tomorrow.

00:46:32.749 --> 00:46:33.708
Well…

00:46:36.169 --> 00:46:39.297
Can you stay in Korea for a little longer?

00:46:45.595 --> 00:46:46.429
What's this?

00:46:51.518 --> 00:46:53.478
"VIP charity auction"?

00:46:54.479 --> 00:46:56.314
Am I allowed to go to such a place?

00:46:56.397 --> 00:46:57.524
You are already

00:46:58.816 --> 00:46:59.943
my VIP.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.239
That's so sweet of you.

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:13.122
We spent too much on the initial cost.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.876
I'm worried we might go broke.

00:47:17.627 --> 00:47:20.421
I will retrieve it big-time for you.
Don't worry.

00:47:24.175 --> 00:47:25.677
Wait, Yi-rang.

00:47:26.344 --> 00:47:29.180
What's up with that weird look?

00:47:29.264 --> 00:47:30.723
Your eyebrows are connected.

00:47:32.517 --> 00:47:34.602
That is such a bold comment.

00:47:35.186 --> 00:47:36.854
So, are you going Frida Kahlo this time?

00:47:39.107 --> 00:47:42.944
The greatest female artist of the era

00:47:43.027 --> 00:47:47.907
who expressed all the pain of her life
on the canvas in vivid colors.

00:47:49.158 --> 00:47:52.453
So what are you going to do
dressed like Hurida?

00:47:52.537 --> 00:47:54.038
It's not Hurida. It's Frida.

00:47:54.122 --> 00:47:55.999
As in "free." Frida Kahlo.

00:47:56.082 --> 00:47:57.208
-Okay?
-Oh, "free."

00:47:57.292 --> 00:47:58.668
"Free-da."

00:47:59.419 --> 00:48:02.714
I'm preparing a bait to catch Mr. Famous.

00:48:02.797 --> 00:48:04.465
-A bait?
-I don't bite it.

00:48:05.967 --> 00:48:09.887
We'll dangle the bait
using Mr. Famous's most powerful memories.

00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:11.264
Powerful memories?

00:48:11.764 --> 00:48:13.516
Frida… Bait…

00:48:14.475 --> 00:48:17.270
-I don't know. Whatever.
-What?

00:48:18.187 --> 00:48:21.608
The incident
that got Mr. Famous his biggest fame.

00:48:21.691 --> 00:48:26.195
I'll make him feel the joy of discovering
a famous painter's hidden painting again.

00:48:26.279 --> 00:48:30.408
So you'll make him
discover an artist through a forgery.

00:48:32.035 --> 00:48:32.869
First,

00:48:33.953 --> 00:48:36.205
the painter
with the greatest artistic skills,

00:48:36.289 --> 00:48:37.749
Yun Yi-rang's…

00:48:40.251 --> 00:48:41.210
Vermeer.

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.342
What's up with that earring?

00:48:49.802 --> 00:48:50.637
Why are you laughing?

00:48:51.387 --> 00:48:54.974
DOKSIMNI
ANTIQUE ART

00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:06.694
Excuse me.

00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:10.490
Look who it is!

00:49:11.449 --> 00:49:12.659
Look who's here!

00:49:12.742 --> 00:49:16.871
My tangy, dangly, spangly, zangy,
lovely little Yun Yi-rang!

00:49:18.081 --> 00:49:19.374
How have you been, sir?

00:49:19.457 --> 00:49:22.043
Not good, of course.

00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:24.337
How could I have been well
when I missed you this much?

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:25.755
This much!

00:49:26.339 --> 00:49:27.423
That's such an old joke.

00:49:28.341 --> 00:49:29.717
And how do you know that joke?

00:49:30.301 --> 00:49:31.135
Anyway, who is he?

00:49:32.053 --> 00:49:32.970
-He's…
-I'm Kim Yong-bok!

00:49:33.054 --> 00:49:35.473
Born in 1958, the Year of the Dog.
Woof woof!

00:49:36.057 --> 00:49:36.933
I don't like this guy.

00:49:39.143 --> 00:49:41.771
He's a painting restorer on the outside,

00:49:41.854 --> 00:49:43.690
but he's actually the Meegeren of Korea.

00:49:43.773 --> 00:49:44.857
Meegeren?

00:49:44.941 --> 00:49:47.110
The notorious art forger.

00:49:47.193 --> 00:49:49.737
-The one who fooled the German Nazis--
-Look it up.

00:49:49.821 --> 00:49:50.780
Are you a finger prince?

00:49:50.863 --> 00:49:51.989
"A finger prince?"

00:49:52.073 --> 00:49:53.741
It means use your fingers to look it up.

00:49:55.368 --> 00:49:58.996
So is this your forgery factory?

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:01.708
Come on. Not here.

00:50:04.752 --> 00:50:08.297
You'll see it if you keep going this way.

00:50:08.381 --> 00:50:13.052
The perfect forgery factory
where my art world spreads!

00:50:13.136 --> 00:50:17.515
Since the man with the perfect skills
paints with the same art supplies,

00:50:17.598 --> 00:50:21.394
no wonder a perfect forgery is created
without the risk of getting caught.

00:50:23.354 --> 00:50:26.607
Sir, then do you think
you can also fool Mr. Famous?

00:50:27.108 --> 00:50:27.942
Who?

00:50:30.153 --> 00:50:33.489
The greenhorn who's on a show
counting on his handsome face?

00:50:33.573 --> 00:50:35.450
He's nothing compared to me!

00:50:35.533 --> 00:50:37.243
Hey, I really don't like you.

00:50:38.286 --> 00:50:40.955
Paintings are all about confidence.
I'm counting on you, Mr. Kim.

00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:42.749
Don't worry. You can count on me.

00:50:48.212 --> 00:50:49.964
What we need now is Elcasso.

00:50:50.047 --> 00:50:53.468
He spent his entire life
doing nothing but painting.

00:50:53.551 --> 00:50:56.262
So, he left behind a mountain of work.

00:50:56.345 --> 00:50:59.724
And countless pieces of his
vanished during the war.

00:51:00.266 --> 00:51:04.479
These canvases here are all
by obscure painters from Elcasso's time.

00:51:04.562 --> 00:51:07.023
We'll paint over them,

00:51:07.106 --> 00:51:11.319
bake them evenly in that oven,
and age them.

00:51:11.402 --> 00:51:14.614
Then they will become
paintings of Elcasso,

00:51:15.239 --> 00:51:17.575
lost to history,
reborn with the marks of time.

00:51:19.994 --> 00:51:23.456
I pray that it doesn't come out
better than Elcasso's!

00:51:23.539 --> 00:51:25.792
Please.

00:51:27.585 --> 00:51:29.045
A FEW DAYS LATER

00:51:33.633 --> 00:51:34.634
He's here.

00:51:35.218 --> 00:51:36.135
Yes.

00:51:36.219 --> 00:51:37.428
Please take a seat here.

00:51:38.137 --> 00:51:38.971
Okay.

00:51:39.972 --> 00:51:42.725
Nice to meet you. Prepare the drinks.

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:45.728
Nice house you have here.

00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:48.648
I asked you to come

00:51:48.731 --> 00:51:51.692
because I want you to evaluate
a painting that I want to sell.

00:51:52.443 --> 00:51:55.238
Then can I take a look?

00:51:55.321 --> 00:51:57.406
I'll show you
as long as you promise me not to rip it.

00:51:59.784 --> 00:52:00.618
I guess

00:52:02.078 --> 00:52:03.496
that must have bothered you.

00:52:06.165 --> 00:52:08.251
I actually became a fan of yours
after seeing that.

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.503
You know how the showbiz runs.

00:52:10.586 --> 00:52:13.214
I couldn't help it
because of the viewer ratings.

00:52:14.006 --> 00:52:16.342
Right. You have to say things
you don't want to say.

00:52:28.646 --> 00:52:29.772
It's Elcasso's work.

00:52:30.231 --> 00:52:32.108
I need to observe it carefully.

00:52:33.609 --> 00:52:34.735
Sorry?

00:52:35.736 --> 00:52:39.323
There are many forgeries
of Elcasso's works.

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:42.660
Is that so?

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.580
It's from Elcasso's Rose Period.

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.415
The Nazis confiscated it,

00:52:47.498 --> 00:52:50.835
then one collector bought it from
the black market and brought it to Korea.

00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:52.670
And my grandfather purchased it.

00:52:52.753 --> 00:52:54.255
Let me take a look.

00:53:07.768 --> 00:53:08.603
Here is the last room.

00:53:08.686 --> 00:53:11.314
Because it's facing south,

00:53:11.397 --> 00:53:13.816
even though the sun has already set,
it's still bright.

00:53:14.525 --> 00:53:16.527
Isn't the view nice?

00:53:17.236 --> 00:53:19.989
INQUIRIES

00:53:20.406 --> 00:53:21.699
Isn't it gorgeous?

00:53:24.577 --> 00:53:28.039
INQUIRIES FOR SALES

00:53:40.343 --> 00:53:41.344
Are you done yet?

00:53:41.427 --> 00:53:42.511
Oh, stop.

00:53:42.595 --> 00:53:43.429
What?

00:53:43.512 --> 00:53:44.347
-What?
-What?

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:45.264
-What?
-What?

00:53:45.348 --> 00:53:48.184
I mean, if you could observe it
more carefully…

00:53:48.809 --> 00:53:51.062
-More carefully. Thanks.
-Okay.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.815
If you're done, shall we go down?

00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:07.662
-Was that from upstairs?
-Oh, right.

00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:10.915
Tell the kids to stop running upstairs.

00:54:10.998 --> 00:54:11.958
Yes, sir.

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.421
How many children do you have?

00:54:19.048 --> 00:54:21.175
I have a son and a daughter.

00:54:21.968 --> 00:54:23.511
How old is your son?

00:54:23.594 --> 00:54:25.304
-Seventy…
-Seventy?

00:54:26.889 --> 00:54:29.308
I mean seven.

00:54:32.395 --> 00:54:35.022
The chairman is thorough
with everything he does.

00:54:35.481 --> 00:54:36.607
I see.

00:54:37.191 --> 00:54:40.111
Now, if you're done, shall we go down?

00:54:41.946 --> 00:54:43.572
He's water divining.

00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:45.116
Please be quiet.

00:54:48.911 --> 00:54:50.538
What are you doing? Hurry up.

00:54:50.621 --> 00:54:52.790
We're in a rush. We look weird.

00:55:00.881 --> 00:55:02.675
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

00:55:04.552 --> 00:55:07.680
Well, by any chance…

00:55:07.763 --> 00:55:08.597
Yes?

00:55:10.933 --> 00:55:11.934
Can you show me

00:55:14.395 --> 00:55:16.063
the certificate of authenticity
for that work?

00:55:16.147 --> 00:55:17.481
-No.
-No?

00:55:17.565 --> 00:55:18.566
I mean… Sure.

00:55:20.192 --> 00:55:21.318
Let me see here.

00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:23.863
Here it is.

00:55:31.746 --> 00:55:34.665
Where was this purchased?

00:55:38.127 --> 00:55:39.587
The Nazis had confiscated it.

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:42.673
Then a collector bought it from
the black market and brought it to Korea.

00:55:42.757 --> 00:55:44.592
And my grandfather purchased it.

00:55:45.926 --> 00:55:46.761
When?

00:55:46.844 --> 00:55:47.678
The Nazis…

00:55:49.013 --> 00:55:49.847
confiscated…

00:55:51.057 --> 00:55:53.517
My grandfather bought it. I'm not sure…

00:55:55.811 --> 00:55:56.645
I don't think so.

00:56:03.611 --> 00:56:04.445
Darn it.

00:56:08.157 --> 00:56:09.784
I don't think it's fake.

00:56:12.787 --> 00:56:13.788
This Elcasso painting…

00:56:17.333 --> 00:56:18.959
May I take it over?

00:56:23.923 --> 00:56:24.840
Sure.

00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:29.553
I will do my best to raise the price.

00:56:36.185 --> 00:56:37.019
What?

00:56:38.479 --> 00:56:41.190
We were checking how stable the house is.

00:56:52.868 --> 00:56:54.036
See?

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:57.123
I told you
even Mr. Famous would fall for it.

00:56:57.206 --> 00:56:59.583
Now, let's start working on other painters
one by one.

00:57:00.126 --> 00:57:02.962
All right.
Let's wet our whistles to celebrate.

00:57:03.045 --> 00:57:05.047
-You're talking like an old man.
-What the heck?

00:57:05.756 --> 00:57:08.676
Why do good beginnings always end badly?

00:57:08.759 --> 00:57:09.593
What the heck?

00:57:19.562 --> 00:57:20.813
-What?
-Wait.

00:57:20.896 --> 00:57:21.897
What's going on?

00:57:23.482 --> 00:57:24.400
Mr. Kim…

00:58:06.859 --> 00:58:07.818
Mr. Famous's list?

00:58:07.902 --> 00:58:10.279
The artwork ledger
that Mr. Famous used for deals.

00:58:11.071 --> 00:58:12.740
It must be here somewhere.

00:58:13.699 --> 00:58:15.451
I can see through all of them.

00:58:15.534 --> 00:58:16.493
No one can fool me.

00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:19.163
James, buy me more time.

00:58:19.246 --> 00:58:20.998
Where are you? Get out of there now.

00:58:21.081 --> 00:58:22.166
I found it.

00:58:22.249 --> 00:58:23.292
Should I call the police?

00:58:23.375 --> 00:58:26.212
Gosh, this jerk.
He's an even bigger piece of trash.

00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:30.591
Now that I threw the bait,
there should be a bite.

00:58:31.592 --> 00:58:36.222
We underestimated him.
We were completely wrong.
