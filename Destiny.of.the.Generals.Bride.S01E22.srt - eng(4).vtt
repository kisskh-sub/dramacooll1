=Destiny of the General's Bride=

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.020
=Episode 22=

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:20.679
There's news from Qiongzhou.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.559
It's been found.

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:24.000
Second Master of the Xiao family are not dead.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.879
He was taken away and hidden
by a group of masked men.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.359
Who found him?

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:34.920
Someone who had a grudge
against Xiao Ye?

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.520
The messenger only gave me
this painting.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.399
My son's fate is unfortunate,

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.479
yet he treats Your Lordship
with complete sincerity

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.359
I beg Your Lordship to uphold justice

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.359
and apprehend both Xiao Yun
and Qing Yan.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.600
Even a thousand cuts would not be
too much, Your Lordship.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.480
It is His Lordship.

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:06.439
Who is there?

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.719
Guards!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.760
Don't move!

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.879
Hurry up.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:25.159
Everyone step back.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.719
Yes.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.159
You dare come back.

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:30.920
Could it be

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:33.680
that you still want to seek justice
for your husband?

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.959
Your Lordship,

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.519
I've already found the killer
of Xiao Ye.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.760
I ask Your Lordship
to restore Xiao Yun's innocence.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.959
Very well.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.920
Then tell me,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.040
who is the culprit, exactly?

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280
No matter who it is,

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.560
it's definitely not Xiao Yun.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.680
Your Lordship.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.180
(Imperial Uncle of Xiling
respectfully reports)

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.520
You actually dare to use
Princess to pressure me?

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.590
Your Lordship, how could I dare to use
Princess to pressure you?

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:29.159
Princess is close to me
and my husband.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.879
She is concerned about Xiao Yun's life,

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:31.919
which is only natural.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.479
I only reported to the Princess

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.000
to ask for her help.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.319
Very well.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.680
I'll give you three days.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.759
Once the time is up,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.639
if you cannot catch the killer,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.039
don't blame me for being ruthless.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.960
Nothing can be seen from this.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.199
What does it even mean?

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:00.960
Those who faked Xiao Ye's death

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.120
are His Lordship's men.

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.199
They want to frame General.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.159
Strange.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.879
Xiao Ye has no more use.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.400
So why would His Lordship do this?

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.680
Nan Jiang, I must ask Xiao Yun
for clarification.

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.319
I'll investigate His Lordship's
relationship with the Xiao family.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.719
Nan Jiang, this matter is complicated.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.599
I fear there's a greater
conspiracy behind it.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.280
I don't want to involve you.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.879
What are you saying?

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.199
You still don't trust me
with such a small matter?

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:36.759
Moreover,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.879
I now have helpers.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.879
Nan Jiang.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.759
Look.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.560
Now, I also have helpers.

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:54.800
You should be happy for me.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.919
Yes.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.759
Madam,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.199
I will protect Nan Jiang well.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.919
Have some snacks.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.759
Have some snacks.

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:16.199
Stand there.

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.160
I said no.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.360
Xiao Yun is already
a death row prisoner.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.480
An outsider cannot just visit him.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.920
General was once a hero
on the battlefield.

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.360
Everyone relied on him.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.360
Now he's wrongly imprisoned,

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.519
and has become someone everyone fears,
a death row prisoner?

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:42.680
I only follow the law.

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.160
The law doesn't say

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.519
that ordinary people
can freely visit a death row prisoner.

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.079
Sir, haven't you forgotten?

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.199
There's another clause in the law.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.800
Before execution,

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.680
a death row prisoner may
leave descendants with his wife.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:04.959
Haven't you heard?

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.360
Sir.

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.279
Why aren't you

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.879
mentioning this clause?

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:13.800
Don't you acknowledge it?

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:43.160
Don't stay too long.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.279
Yun.

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:51.279
Why are you here?

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.959
Of course because I miss you.

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.160
I think of you in my heart,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.439
and also hold you close in my arms.

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:02.759
What?

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.600
My husband and I are about
to perform our marital rites.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.920
Do you also want to watch?

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.800
How can you take such a risk?

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.120
The warden hasn't gone far yet.

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:58.680
You really have the mind for it.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.319
What?

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:02.680
You...

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.399
You don't want to do that with me?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.279
Xiao Ye is not dead.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.160
His Lordship deliberately harmed you.

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:24.800
Did you two ever have a conflict?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.800
Never.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.680
It's just that His Lordship
has always favored Xiao Ye.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.519
Naturally, he despised me even more.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Every birthday,

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.360
the treasures Xiao Ye
received from the palace

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:38.520
exceeded even those of the heir.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.720
The Xiao family's prosperity

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.079
was entirely granted by His Lordship.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.199
Grand Madam Xiao is
from the Zhang clan of Langya.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.600
How did she get involved
with His Lordship?

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:51.720
Unknown.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.279
I don't know if His Lordship,
grieving for lost love,

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:56.360
lost his composure,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.600
or if there's another scheme.

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:00.879
Qing Yan,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.959
you must not investigate further.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.319
I haven't given up yet.

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:10.279
How could you give up before me?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.600
His Lordship and Grand Madam Xiao

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.199
are both not kind people.

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:15.560
They are ruthless.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.759
I don't want you to get involved.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.439
Fighting for the one you love

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.759
isn't a privilege of men.

00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:26.079
I can protect you just the same,

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:27.800
and restore your innocence.

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:30.800
You must wait for me.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:35.320
Promise me

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.600
that you will return to me
safe and sound.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.399
Qing Yan is out today on some business.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.159
I heard you came early this morning.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.600
I just made some pear soup.

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:55.559
Try it quickly.

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:58.559
Let's talk about the main matter first.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.320
Why so tense?

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.480
That rascal Xiao Ye

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.360
is actually His Lordship's
illegitimate child.

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:07.879
Is it true?

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:09.360
Absolutely.

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:10.960
I went to great lengths

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.879
to find out from Xiao family's
old servant.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.960
That's why Xiao Ye and His Lordship

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.960
have been scheming together all along.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.399
In that case,

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.960
the relationship between
His Lordship and Xiao Ye

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:24.759
is far closer than we knew.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.600
Then Grand Madam Xiao...

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:30.919
Could she be His Lordship's lover?

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:38.120
No, that's not it.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.279
Xiao Ye's biological mother
is someone else.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.480
She passed away many years ago.

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:45.639
Since His Lordship
claims Xiao Ye is dead,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.360
he won't let us find him so easily.

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:52.519
He's avenging his son.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.360
Then what should we do?

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:56.840
You must find Madam quickly,

00:09:57.039 --> 00:09:57.720
and consult with her.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.679
She will have a plan.

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:03.919
Grand Madam.

00:10:05.759 --> 00:10:06.320
Grand Madam.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.519
Is it done?

00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:11.080
I've already spoken with
the warden in the prison.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.639
As long as First Master admits

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:14.240
that it was plotted with First Madam,

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:15.679
any method will do.

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:16.600
But...

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:18.320
But what?

00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:20.360
First Master...

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:21.919
Speak quickly.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.080
There's no unbroken flesh left on him,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.360
yet he still refuses to admit it.

00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:26.600
He says

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
that First Madam
has nothing to do with it.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.360
Then change the torture method,

00:10:33.919 --> 00:10:35.559
see how long he can endure.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.360
This guy's tough.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.840
He survived that night, 20 years ago.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.919
It's time

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:46.039
to make this monster

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.519
pay double with her.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.240
(Memorial Tablet of Mother, Mo Mei))
If His Lordship finds out...

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:08.240
The dead cannot speak.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:33.919
Qing Yan.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.519
Qing Yan.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.039
I...

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.799
I'll wait for you.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.320
I...
