WEBVTT

00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.310
(Social Welfare)

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.340
Down there.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.010
What does "full adoption" mean?

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.850
(Full adoption, 1999)

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.980
What exactly does it mean?

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.090
Unbelievable.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.090
How pathetic.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.700
I gave birth to that thing?

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.540
My sister...

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.150
Ji Eun Oh and I aren't related?

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.550
(Episode 11)

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.890
She actually witnessed the accident.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.060
It was at the intersection.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.560
I have other things to do and will get going.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.230
- Sure. - It happened at the crosswalk.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.600
Yes, I'm on my way.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.330
Traffic is heavy, so I'll be about five minutes late.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.710
Are you saying you actually saw it happen?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.220
(Ambulance)

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.890
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.320
We'll get the car off the road.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.990
What a relief.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.870
What...

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.780
Oh, no.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.350
But it was from Director Ko.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.450
(Resume)

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.160
It wouldn't surprise me...

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.590
if he made a pass at Yeong Ra.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.470
We're down to 2 from 20.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.070
As for these two candidates, nothing stands out.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.740
They don't present any threats either.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.270
As you know, they're already married...

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.980
and each has two children.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.680
Did you find out why they left their old jobs?

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.950
Mr. Han quit his job as a bodyguard...

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.850
because his wife wasn't fond of his irregular hours.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.850
Unbelievable.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.060
Yet he interviewed for a job where he gets off work at 10pm.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.760
As for Mr. Ryu, he quit his job when a board member...

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.960
at the broadcasting station retired.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.660
Why didn't he re-sign with the company?

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.430
You should look into that.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.100
I don't understand what you want me to find out.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.540
I see skeletons in their closet.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.870
Don't you see them too, Ms. Shin?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.510
Of course. I'll look into why...

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.280
Mr. Han and Mr. Ryu really left their jobs.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.680
The money has been wired.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.390
Are you also looking into Seonggol Group?

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.190
Of course. Thank you for your time.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.860
- This is the master bedroom. - No way.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.230
Ta-da. This is the master bedroom.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.690
- No way. - My gosh.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.700
You're moving into a new home.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.000
I totally agree, ma'am.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.830
Gosh, please be careful.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.570
You might get paint on you.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.170
You should watch out.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.910
This was supposed to be DIY interior design,

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.580
but they managed the project and even hired all the workers.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.210
- Really? - Is that true?

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.750
I designed the place the way I wanted.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.920
- These were all my ideas. - Really?

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.450
Would you like to see the walk-in closet?

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.920
- Of course. - Come this way.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.320
- Goodness. - Come on over.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.490
See how the walls were done.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.960
Ms. Ji, your eyes look hollow.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.090
Are you not feeling well?

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.460
It's not that. I'm just tired from working on...

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.670
two projects at once.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.430
How can I know if you're tired,

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.400
sick, or heartbroken...

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.100
when you rarely show us how you feel?

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.810
I'll have fattened up by the time we start our job in Mapo.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.180
Goodness!

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.510
This is so nice. Oh, my.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.960
Mom.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.760
What is it, Gang Oh?

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.890
(Certificate of Adoption)

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.530
Explain this.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.760
What do you have there?

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.100
You adopted Ji Eun Oh on November 15, 1999.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.040
Is this true?

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.670
How...

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.440
You went home saying you were sick.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.980
Where did you find this?

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.250
Applied by Ji Yeong Min, Adopter, Jeong Sun Hui.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.620
That's you and Dad.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.850
Was Eun Oh adopted?

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.560
Yes, but...

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.090
Where on earth did you find this?

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.430
I found it among the forms for renouncing Dad's inheritance.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.800
- Why did you look through there? - How's that important right now...

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.570
when Ji Eun Oh isn't my real sister?

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.070
Can you imagine how I'm feeling right now?

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.810
Right, of course.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.540
This must have come as a shock.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.280
But Gang Oh...

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.850
Gang Oh, look at me.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.080
Eun Oh...

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.250
is your big sister.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.820
She's your dad's and my daughter.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.460
You're not blood-related!

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.890
She's been treating me this way not knowing the truth!

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.300
I'm going to tell her.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.600
She already knows,

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.200
so don't do anything unnecessary.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.570
She knows?

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.090
(Just us)

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.200
After weeks of nothing but work, I'm completely stressed out.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.170
(Just us)

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.110
Let's do some gaming for just one hour.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.680
Our captain has spoken.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.050
(Just us)

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.520
When, captain?

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.990
Let's leave together when I get there in 15 minutes.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.460
Okay?

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.430
Okay.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.460
(Consignor: Mamdaerozip, Assignee: Seol Woo Jae)

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.430
When can I start working?

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.640
Two more projects are in the pipeline,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.600
so you'll get a call in a week or two.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.710
Where did you get the idea to do this?

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.280
The thought came to me like it was meant to be.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.280
Hey.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.050
What's that?

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.120
It's nothing at all.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.560
(You have a new message: Mom)

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.990
I'm right on time, aren't I?

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.460
You are. Give me a minute.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.460
Sure.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.030
Are you ready?

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.570
Yes.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.340
Bye, then.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.980
- I hope to hear from you soon. - Okay.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.220
What are you doing here during work hours?

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.560
I have an appointment.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.760
An appointment?

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.990
We can go now.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.830
Where are you three going?

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.400
There's a thing. It's just us.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:46.570
"Just us?"

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.440
Cover for me, Min Woo. I won't be too long.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.510
Okay.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.080
Hey, you, Ji Eun Oh!

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.560
You knew?

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.030
You knew we weren't related?

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.310
You were adopted.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.910
You knew that, and you still bullied me?

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:27.810
What...

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.320
Gang Oh.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.720
Let's talk in private.

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:38.790
What for?

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.930
You're not even my sister.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.360
You bullied me all this time, knowing we weren't even related?

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.910
Hey. Come with me.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.980
Let go of me. Who are you?

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.760
Let me go!

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:10.790
You.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.330
Get a hold of yourself. This is a coffee shop.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.000
Are you really Eun Oh's brother?

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.830
Aren't you old enough to know what not to yell in public?

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.100
Don't you care about your sister?

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.530
Why should I care how she feels?

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.970
We're not related!

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.770
Who are you people?

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.110
- I'm her senior. - I'm her senior.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:29.980
Why are you her senior?

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.150
That's what she called me...

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.810
until I started my current job.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.050
Didn't you know that?

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.350
Why are you getting in the way when it's none of your business?

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.460
- What did you say? - What did you say?

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.990
Hey.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.660
Do you want a good beating?

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.060
I miss corporal punishment.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.700
You two.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.000
Can you go inside?

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.210
Watch your language.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.620
I got Mom's text.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.590
You went to her first?

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.220
Yes. She confirmed it.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.960
She even said you knew we weren't related.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.660
Yes.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.200
I heard about it when I was in ninth grade.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.440
What I don't get is why you're so angry.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.540
I'm our parents' daughter...

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.940
and you're my little brother.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.210
Our parents made that decision, and that's how things were.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.540
Then you should've stopped at pretending to be their daughter.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.080
You're nothing to me.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.550
You took the money that was meant for me!

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:45.720
What?

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.690
Gang Oh.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.920
What did you just say?

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.090
Why do you think I gave up soccer?

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.130
I was ten years old when Dad's business flopped.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.000
I had to quit my private lessons...

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.800
because you spent all my money.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.770
Jang Seon Woo stayed on to train and joined the national team...

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.540
while I had to quit because of you.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.940
How can you say that?

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.040
We're siblings, Gang Oh.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.610
We're not actual siblings.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.110
We're not related.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.350
You knew that all along and pretended to be my real sister.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.720
You berated me...

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.120
and told me to spend less!

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.790
You have no shame.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.050
How dare you...

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.920
- Are you going to run your mouth? - Yes!

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.760
What you're doing right now.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.930
You're acting like you're my sister.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.230
This is what makes me so angry!

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.400
Until Dad's business failed,

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.700
you learned piano, ballet, art, everything you wanted.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.340
And all from a private tutor.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.140
All that money could've gone to my soccer lessons!

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.110
If Dad hadn't spent all that on you,

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.180
he might not have lost his business.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.260
I...

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.490
I don't know what to say.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.600
I bet you don't.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.160
You'd better not have a single excuse.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.400
What do you want to do, then?

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.530
I don't know!

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.440
Make up for it.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.590
You're all in here.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.700
Mr. Park, let's call today off.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.700
Sorry, Su Jeong.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:38.730
Where are you going?

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.500
To my mom's restaurant.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.500
To help with the dinner rush since Gang Oh won't be there.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.200
Right now?

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.110
Treat us to a meal next time.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.340
Okay.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.550
- My gosh. - My gosh.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.150
I need a drink.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.920
Don't think of going without me.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.630
Come to Agit now for a shift,

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.200
and I'll pay you 20 dollars an hour.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.440
(Value of Hangyeol Juniors)

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.380
You didn't know either, Ji Hyuk?

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.180
I had no clue.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.350
Me neither.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.750
Eun Oh cared so much about her family.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.120
She saved up her salary for four years...

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.190
to open a restaurant for her mom,

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.620
and they moved too.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:36.260
It was a rental, but still.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.190
Eun Oh paid for all that?

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.230
Did you just say Eun Oh paid for the restaurant?

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.530
She didn't just chip in?

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.330
I went to help out once...

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:49.870
around the time it opened.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.310
I found out only because her mom told me.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.640
That's why she saved up while at Doogle for four years?

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.810
You called yourself Eun Oh's closest friend...

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.910
and you didn't know that?

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.590
Her father went bankrupt when she was in tenth grade,

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.120
and he died two years later.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.560
I knew they were poor.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.230
She was always working...

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:14.830
and she studied hard to keep her scholarship.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.400
I guess I was just a superficial friend.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.000
I thought I knew her through and through.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:26.770
No one...

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.640
shows anyone what they're truly like.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.250
Hello?

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:40.450
Yes.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:41.990
Right now?

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.920
Yes, if you come right away.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.390
Bye.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:47.960
Eun Oh.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.630
Gang Oh went to see you, didn't he?

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.730
Well? What did he say?

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.700
It's a busy day today.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.070
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.510
I was going to close for the day,

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.080
but people kept coming in.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.410
Why would you close when it's not a scheduled holiday?

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:06.980
How could I concentrate?

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.350
Mom. You don't work because you can concentrate.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.420
You work because you must.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.020
That sounds familiar.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.460
I quoted Dad.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.730
- Excuse me? - Yes?

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.260
Can we have more pickled garlic stems...

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.630
- Yes. - and two bottles of soju?

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.230
- I'll get that right away. - Thanks.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.810
She was adopted?

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.980
Even so, how dare her brother talk like that?

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.450
How must she feel,

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.550
having to go help her mom after hearing all that?

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.320
It's madness.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:50.790
I feel betrayed,

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.060
so what does that say about me?

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.830
You feel betrayed?

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.530
I've been her friend since we met...

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.530
at our volunteer club in college.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.170
When Agit first opened,

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.540
she hired me...

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.610
so I could stop hopping from one part-time job to another.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.240
Being close doesn't mean she had to say she was adopted.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.580
That's not what I mean.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:13.650
I mean, Eun Oh's personality.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.220
She always had a positive and upbeat attitude.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.420
She's bright, tireless,

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.590
unyielding, and unbowed.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.520
Earlier,

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.460
she seemed so different.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.460
She didn't seem like the Eun Oh I've known.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.200
How could she live like that...

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.770
when she had such a history?

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.210
Come to think of it,

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:41.840
aside from the cafeteria meals...

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.510
and club after-parties back in college,

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.410
we rarely ate out together...

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.210
during the years we worked together at the cafe.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.650
She said her favourite food was triangle gimbap.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.490
To me, she said gukbap was her favourite.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.290
She's on good terms with her mother, though.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.460
She also said she really loved her late father.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.540
(Winter 2015)

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.670
My club juniors insisted on throwing a birthday party for me,

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:13.640
so I gave in.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:15.610
You should come too.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.350
(To the right)

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.590
What?

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.210
Is she a fool or what?

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.220
Oh, no. This... What?

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.690
Thank you. Hang on.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:10.600
What?

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.670
This is amazing.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.170
It's not ruined at all. It's fine.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.610
- What? - This cake.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.410
I made it myself.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.740
It's the birthday of someone important.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.950
I see.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.280
What a relief.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.150
- Thank you. - All right.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.580
Thank you so much.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:38.920
Gosh, it hurts.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.630
She's off the wall.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:46.900
Birthday?

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.180
(Father)

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.350
Wherever you are, come home right away.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.850
We'll be having dinner at home.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.490
Please come this way.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.190
- Come here. - Here. Hey, come over here.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.400
- Please have a seat. - One, two, three.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.500
- Hello, we're Value of Hangyeol. - Hello, we're Value of Hangyeol.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.730
(Architecture Volunteer Club, Value of Hangyeol)

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.640
Hello.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.010
Are you here to join a club?

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.770
No.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.210
I guess you're here to get some information.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.140
I'm glad you're here.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.310
Our club is a place where you can do really fun and exciting activities.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.920
School life and job hunting can be really stressful.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.290
Sometimes, you want...

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.590
to focus on something without thinking about other things.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.720
That's when...

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.130
you should start renovating and decorating a house.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.730
Then all the districting thoughts will go away.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.200
When the house is finished, you feel a great sense of accomplishment.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.670
It feels so rewarding.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.900
Is that so?

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.040
Yes.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.000
By the way,

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.510
was I rambling on about it without asking...

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.840
when your major was something related to architecture?

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.350
I major in business administration.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.850
Then you must be interested in volunteering.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.350
I believe it will suit you well.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.990
You can volunteer and relieve stress.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:18.890
I guess you're right.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.460
Would you like to join us?

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.500
I'm Lee Ji Hyuk from the 16th batch.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.970
Why did you not tell me?

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.070
What?

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.610
Did you just say Lee Ji Hyuk?

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.380
The Lee Ji Hyuk?

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.550
I heard you'd return to school, so I've been waiting for you.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.580
Guys!

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.550
He's Lee Ji Hyuk from the 16th batch.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.020
- What? - My gosh.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.560
- Hello. - Hello.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.460
- Hello. - Go back to what you were doing.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.830
- Okay. My goodness. - My gosh.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.460
(Architecture Volunteer Club, Value of Hangyeol)

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.630
So you were Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.200
Nice to meet you.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.500
I'm Ji Eun Oh from the 19th batch.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.740
I hope we will get along well.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.010
It depends on how you do.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.340
I'll do well.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:14.650
You'll do well?

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.350
Yes.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.490
You're reckless.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.420
When I do what I like, I tend to be reckless.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.830
Ji Hyuk.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.940
I should get going.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.500
What?

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.010
My father wants me to come home.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.140
Then...

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.010
We should get going too.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.450
Are we going home already?

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.220
While feeling this way?

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.050
I have to go to work early tomorrow morning.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.290
I'm a handyman.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.120
What?

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.230
I just looked at your face.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.400
I even called Hye Na.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.970
I'm still in shock.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:11.770
You won't shake off the shock even if you drink all night.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:14.910
- Give me that. - Wait.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:16.440
You're done, right?

00:22:16.672 --> 00:22:17.802
It's cassia seed tea.

00:22:18.095 --> 00:22:20.225
It seemed like your eyes were strained yesterday.

00:22:20.225 --> 00:22:21.365
Thank you.

00:22:22.665 --> 00:22:25.465
Seong Jae should come quickly so you can have dinner.

00:22:25.735 --> 00:22:26.795
Let's wait and see...

00:22:26.795 --> 00:22:28.735
if he will let me starve or not.

00:22:30.705 --> 00:22:31.935
By the way,

00:22:32.235 --> 00:22:35.045
how long have you known...

00:22:35.045 --> 00:22:37.105
CEO Min Tae Ho of Hyeonu Fashion?

00:22:39.745 --> 00:22:41.685
Why are you asking such a thing?

00:22:42.415 --> 00:22:43.415
What?

00:22:43.685 --> 00:22:45.485
You're not interested in my work.

00:22:46.055 --> 00:22:48.885
And I'm not the type of person to bring work home.

00:22:50.685 --> 00:22:54.395
You know, he's a powerful figure in the business community.

00:22:54.395 --> 00:22:56.095
I guess I found it interesting.

00:22:57.265 --> 00:22:58.695
Aren't you hungry?

00:22:58.835 --> 00:23:00.695
Why isn't Seong Jae coming?

00:23:01.605 --> 00:23:03.065
Oh, right. About Seong Jae.

00:23:03.865 --> 00:23:07.605
Are you sure you're looking for Seoung Jae's partner?

00:23:08.645 --> 00:23:10.275
You don't seem to be in a rush.

00:23:12.245 --> 00:23:15.015
I knew you would notice.

00:23:16.315 --> 00:23:17.315
And?

00:23:20.485 --> 00:23:22.555
It's not like I haven't done anything.

00:23:22.925 --> 00:23:25.325
But I'm being a little cautious.

00:23:26.055 --> 00:23:27.225
Cautious?

00:23:30.795 --> 00:23:33.935
It wasn't just any second marriage.

00:23:35.135 --> 00:23:37.435
I had nothing to show for.

00:23:39.475 --> 00:23:42.105
I want to meet your expectations.

00:23:42.805 --> 00:23:45.775
And I want to find a daughter-in-law you'll be satisfied with.

00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:48.585
But the business community isn't so easy.

00:23:49.645 --> 00:23:51.145
I can't help but feel small.

00:23:53.315 --> 00:23:55.355
So I couldn't contact many people.

00:23:56.825 --> 00:23:59.995
And Seong Jae says he's not ready.

00:23:59.995 --> 00:24:01.155
I used it as an excuse.

00:24:02.125 --> 00:24:03.195
I'm sorry.

00:24:03.965 --> 00:24:05.965
It's been years since we got remarried.

00:24:06.495 --> 00:24:09.735
Who would dare to gossip about Park Jin Seok's remarriage?

00:24:11.775 --> 00:24:14.435
They do. Who wouldn't gossip?

00:24:16.345 --> 00:24:18.115
My ex-husband wasn't anyone significant.

00:24:18.915 --> 00:24:20.645
And I'm not from a wealthy family.

00:24:20.975 --> 00:24:22.345
I don't have a good educational background,

00:24:23.045 --> 00:24:24.485
and my career wasn't so great.

00:24:25.355 --> 00:24:26.985
Do you still feel that way?

00:24:28.655 --> 00:24:29.785
You're really...

00:24:31.385 --> 00:24:34.295
You have a tough side, but you're softhearted at the same time.

00:24:53.675 --> 00:24:54.715
Here's your key.

00:24:54.715 --> 00:24:56.285
Okay. Thank you.

00:24:56.285 --> 00:24:57.345
Thank you.

00:25:03.225 --> 00:25:04.995
I won't have dinner until you come home.

00:25:10.465 --> 00:25:12.295
Didn't you have something to say?

00:25:14.565 --> 00:25:17.365
A family should eat together from time to time.

00:25:17.935 --> 00:25:19.835
Why are you never home for dinner?

00:25:21.435 --> 00:25:22.745
I come home late from work.

00:25:23.475 --> 00:25:25.015
Why bother working late...

00:25:25.515 --> 00:25:27.245
when your heart isn't in it?

00:25:28.685 --> 00:25:30.345
You'll give him indigestion.

00:25:30.545 --> 00:25:32.655
I didn't cook Seong Jae's favourite LA galbi...

00:25:32.655 --> 00:25:33.815
just so you could grill him.

00:25:36.585 --> 00:25:38.955
Whatever it is, I'll hear you out.

00:25:42.395 --> 00:25:44.065
You left the office this afternoon...

00:25:44.265 --> 00:25:46.465
and were gone until the end of the workday.

00:25:47.065 --> 00:25:48.065
What were you up to?

00:25:50.035 --> 00:25:51.505
(Ms. Jung Hui Yeong at MJ)

00:25:52.675 --> 00:25:54.205
Sorry to interrupt mealtime,

00:25:54.205 --> 00:25:56.975
but honey, Seong Jae, I need to take this call.

00:25:56.975 --> 00:25:58.045
Sure.

00:26:05.015 --> 00:26:06.285
What have you been up to?

00:26:07.285 --> 00:26:10.085
Are you coursing through life just killing time,

00:26:10.525 --> 00:26:11.795
playing video games?

00:26:13.495 --> 00:26:14.525
I do play games sometimes.

00:26:15.665 --> 00:26:16.825
You pathetic brat.

00:26:17.325 --> 00:26:19.395
This is exactly why you must get married.

00:26:20.295 --> 00:26:22.405
You should marry a woman like your mother.

00:26:24.705 --> 00:26:25.775
Which mother...

00:26:27.435 --> 00:26:29.075
are you referring to?

00:26:30.145 --> 00:26:31.745
Of course not, Ms. Jung.

00:26:31.915 --> 00:26:33.915
I only called so that we could get together.

00:26:34.375 --> 00:26:35.615
Which mother?

00:26:38.045 --> 00:26:39.185
You brat.

00:26:39.685 --> 00:26:41.985
How many times must I tell you that you only have one mother?

00:26:43.855 --> 00:26:45.695
Do you still think of that woman as your mother...

00:26:45.925 --> 00:26:47.595
after she cheated on me and abandoned you?

00:26:47.625 --> 00:26:49.995
You have no right to tell me how to feel.

00:26:49.995 --> 00:26:51.295
A decent person...

00:26:52.265 --> 00:26:54.235
would never abandon their child.

00:26:56.135 --> 00:26:57.235
How can she be your mother...

00:26:57.465 --> 00:27:00.105
when she abandoned you before you could even remember her?

00:27:01.035 --> 00:27:02.845
Anyone who abandons their child is not human.

00:27:03.575 --> 00:27:04.705
I'd call her a monster.

00:27:24.595 --> 00:27:26.765
How dare you say such nonsense?

00:27:28.235 --> 00:27:29.635
Is it because you've been involved...

00:27:29.805 --> 00:27:31.675
with someone unreasonable?

00:27:32.905 --> 00:27:33.975
Tell me.

00:27:34.675 --> 00:27:36.775
Why did you leave the office without giving notice today?

00:27:37.105 --> 00:27:38.175
That's why...

00:27:39.345 --> 00:27:41.015
I work at your company.

00:27:42.115 --> 00:27:43.445
I already told you this.

00:27:44.115 --> 00:27:46.415
Without the freedom that comes with being your successor,

00:27:47.655 --> 00:27:49.125
I can't stand corporate life.

00:27:49.385 --> 00:27:50.485
Park Seong Jae.

00:27:51.995 --> 00:27:54.555
A toothless tiger can't chew anything.

00:27:56.025 --> 00:27:58.635
You'll only get what others have chewed up and spat out.

00:28:14.145 --> 00:28:15.185
Sit.

00:28:15.645 --> 00:28:18.915
I said we should talk after we've cleaned up the place.

00:28:18.915 --> 00:28:20.685
No, tell me right now,

00:28:21.485 --> 00:28:23.825
before I suffocate from not knowing.

00:28:25.225 --> 00:28:26.525
What did Gang Oh say?

00:28:28.425 --> 00:28:29.795
He must've been really shocked.

00:28:30.365 --> 00:28:31.665
He asked why I never told him.

00:28:34.295 --> 00:28:36.205
He went over there just to say that?

00:28:37.305 --> 00:28:40.835
How was it urgent enough to seek you out during the day?

00:28:43.205 --> 00:28:44.975
He was in shock,

00:28:46.375 --> 00:28:47.845
so of course, his temper got the best of him.

00:28:48.115 --> 00:28:49.185
Was he riled up?

00:28:50.485 --> 00:28:51.615
How bad was it?

00:28:52.215 --> 00:28:53.385
What did he say?

00:28:53.855 --> 00:28:55.325
You know how he gets.

00:28:58.055 --> 00:28:59.095
He'll move on from this.

00:29:01.495 --> 00:29:02.825
But you're his big sister.

00:29:04.525 --> 00:29:06.735
I can't believe he's still this immature.

00:29:07.965 --> 00:29:09.405
It's a fact that you're his big sister.

00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:15.005
Of course. Besides, what can he do?

00:29:15.505 --> 00:29:16.645
He can't change anything.

00:29:18.775 --> 00:29:20.545
Mom, are you done cleaning the kitchen?

00:29:21.075 --> 00:29:22.785
Get changed, and we'll head home.

00:29:29.985 --> 00:29:31.025
My gosh.

00:29:38.835 --> 00:29:39.865
Park Seong Jae.

00:29:40.765 --> 00:29:43.305
A toothless tiger can't chew anything.

00:29:44.765 --> 00:29:47.305
You'll only get what others have chewed up and spat out.

00:29:50.845 --> 00:29:52.115
I'm still young,

00:29:54.145 --> 00:29:56.245
but I'm already a toothless tiger.

00:30:04.755 --> 00:30:05.755
What for?

00:30:06.525 --> 00:30:08.395
You're not even my sister.

00:30:09.095 --> 00:30:11.795
You bullied me all this time, knowing we weren't even related?

00:30:20.835 --> 00:30:22.205
A toothless tiger...

00:30:23.145 --> 00:30:24.705
couldn't keep anyone by its side.

00:30:26.245 --> 00:30:27.715
It's far too weak to hunt...

00:30:29.685 --> 00:30:31.015
or fight.

00:30:39.825 --> 00:30:42.325
I'm sure he's out with his friends.

00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:46.995
Will this go on for a week?

00:30:49.365 --> 00:30:50.905
How can a man...

00:30:51.565 --> 00:30:53.235
be shocked by such a thing?

00:30:54.475 --> 00:30:56.605
He even got upset that we never told him.

00:30:57.745 --> 00:30:58.775
Unbelievable.

00:30:59.745 --> 00:31:02.115
I've never given him what he wanted,

00:31:02.715 --> 00:31:03.915
so he's lashing out...

00:31:03.915 --> 00:31:05.955
because he thinks he finally has a reason.

00:31:07.815 --> 00:31:10.385
When will that kid grow up?

00:31:12.225 --> 00:31:13.625
Maybe...

00:31:15.195 --> 00:31:16.295
in a week.

00:31:23.305 --> 00:31:24.705
My gosh.

00:31:25.905 --> 00:31:26.905
Goodness.

00:32:29.535 --> 00:32:31.975
I can't believe you. Aren't you scared to actually sleep here?

00:32:32.335 --> 00:32:34.675
If I say I'm scared, will you sleep here with me?

00:32:35.945 --> 00:32:36.945
What?

00:32:38.105 --> 00:32:41.215
Wait, hold on. Don't get any ideas.

00:32:41.645 --> 00:32:43.515
I didn't mean in the same bed. It's closer...

00:32:43.645 --> 00:32:45.685
to a bodyguard, doorman, or security guard.

00:32:47.755 --> 00:32:48.985
You're 30 now.

00:32:49.385 --> 00:32:50.955
Watch what you say.

00:32:51.355 --> 00:32:53.455
Either way, you're going to leave me here.

00:32:53.455 --> 00:32:55.725
That's right. Like you said, you've slept here more than once.

00:32:56.965 --> 00:32:57.995
Here.

00:32:58.765 --> 00:32:59.865
It may not seem like it,

00:33:00.735 --> 00:33:02.705
but it can be quite cosy.

00:33:06.005 --> 00:33:08.675
I took away the space you use for all-nighters.

00:33:29.825 --> 00:33:31.195
Why are you here so early,

00:33:33.695 --> 00:33:34.765
Ms. Ji?

00:33:34.795 --> 00:33:37.535
To check both the paint job and the cleaning.

00:33:37.965 --> 00:33:39.005
I see.

00:33:39.375 --> 00:33:40.675
It's an overlaying job,

00:33:41.205 --> 00:33:44.205
so I mopped it and vacuumed everything twice.

00:33:44.375 --> 00:33:45.845
I'll be mopping it once more.

00:33:50.245 --> 00:33:51.815
I see you're here early.

00:33:53.215 --> 00:33:55.685
I didn't want anything to get on the paint.

00:33:57.985 --> 00:33:59.395
By the way, this vacuum cleaner...

00:34:00.195 --> 00:34:01.425
works wonders.

00:34:01.695 --> 00:34:03.365
My company should get one.

00:34:04.095 --> 00:34:05.595
I'll get you the model number.

00:34:09.165 --> 00:34:10.465
You obviously didn't get any sleep,

00:34:11.105 --> 00:34:12.735
but you're doing a good job hiding it, Eun Oh.

00:34:14.075 --> 00:34:15.105
What was that?

00:34:16.405 --> 00:34:17.405
Well...

00:34:18.605 --> 00:34:19.615
I mean...

00:34:21.375 --> 00:34:24.045
Did you really know about what he said yesterday?

00:34:25.955 --> 00:34:28.015
- Yes. - Since when?

00:34:31.685 --> 00:34:32.755
Forget I asked.

00:34:46.735 --> 00:34:48.635
- Did you all sleep well? - Hey.

00:34:48.905 --> 00:34:50.545
Su Bin, you're up early today.

00:34:50.545 --> 00:34:52.315
It's been a while since I saw you, Dad.

00:34:55.275 --> 00:34:56.345
Good morning.

00:34:56.485 --> 00:34:57.945
- Hey. - You too?

00:34:58.615 --> 00:35:00.185
Yes, me too.

00:35:00.585 --> 00:35:02.425
I was told to greet him in the morning...

00:35:02.425 --> 00:35:03.825
before he forgot our faces.

00:35:04.425 --> 00:35:06.795
Da Jeong, you were right to order that.

00:35:06.925 --> 00:35:08.255
- Right, Mother? - Absolutely.

00:35:08.455 --> 00:35:10.765
Was this necessary when they don't have breakfast?

00:35:10.765 --> 00:35:12.135
I blame you, Dad.

00:35:12.135 --> 00:35:14.035
Why do you never stay home?

00:35:14.035 --> 00:35:15.165
Don't you get any rest?

00:35:15.395 --> 00:35:17.735
It's your fault we barely get to see you.

00:35:17.735 --> 00:35:18.735
Tell me about it.

00:35:19.035 --> 00:35:21.475
You look awfully tired, Dad.

00:35:21.775 --> 00:35:23.105
Did you lose weight?

00:35:23.275 --> 00:35:25.775
He's giving his all to studying, that's why.

00:35:25.775 --> 00:35:28.815
Ji Wan, how is it going, driving Seong Jae's sister around?

00:35:29.045 --> 00:35:30.545
It seems like you've always been on time.

00:35:30.545 --> 00:35:33.215
Of course. I couldn't do that to Ji Hyuk's reputation.

00:35:33.885 --> 00:35:35.315
Ji Hyuk's reputation?

00:35:35.315 --> 00:35:36.785
It's Seong Jae's reputation you should worry about.

00:35:36.785 --> 00:35:38.225
Come on.

00:35:38.225 --> 00:35:41.655
I'm sure one day Ji Hyuk will make a name for himself too.

00:35:41.655 --> 00:35:43.825
Su Bin, what do you have planned for today?

00:35:43.825 --> 00:35:45.065
I'll be painting the storage unit.

00:35:45.065 --> 00:35:47.295
I'm off to the paint shop to choose a colour,

00:35:47.295 --> 00:35:48.535
and I will paint it in the afternoon.

00:35:48.765 --> 00:35:51.835
Su Bin, when are you heading out?

00:35:51.835 --> 00:35:54.735
I'm meeting Ha Eun outside the subway station at 10am.

00:35:55.775 --> 00:35:58.205
I'll be going out with you.

00:35:58.275 --> 00:36:00.775
Do you have somewhere to go, Mother?

00:36:01.945 --> 00:36:04.515
Oh, of course. You're meeting Ms. Myeong Suk.

00:36:05.085 --> 00:36:07.215
But Mother, isn't Ms. Myeong Suk...

00:36:07.215 --> 00:36:08.785
the hair salon owner...

00:36:08.785 --> 00:36:11.155
from Tongyeong?

00:36:11.155 --> 00:36:13.255
Her son and I are the same age.

00:36:13.255 --> 00:36:15.595
What? No, it's not her.

00:36:16.225 --> 00:36:17.695
It's a different Myeong Suk.

00:36:18.195 --> 00:36:20.765
You must've had a lot of friends in Tongyeong.

00:36:21.165 --> 00:36:24.765
Hardly. Your grandma spent her days...

00:36:24.765 --> 00:36:26.505
cleaning fish at the market...

00:36:26.505 --> 00:36:29.375
and nursing your grandfather at the hospital.

00:36:29.375 --> 00:36:32.005
She didn't have time to make friends.

00:36:32.815 --> 00:36:34.475
As if you know any better.

00:36:34.875 --> 00:36:38.615
Sang Cheol, you were busy with your own life back then...

00:36:38.615 --> 00:36:41.185
and didn't have time to see how I was doing.

00:36:42.885 --> 00:36:43.885
Mother,

00:36:44.225 --> 00:36:46.395
have you and your friend decided to meet...

00:36:46.395 --> 00:36:47.995
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday?

00:36:47.995 --> 00:36:49.525
Gosh, no.

00:36:50.065 --> 00:36:53.335
Myeong Suk and the other friends from the senior citizen center...

00:36:53.335 --> 00:36:55.035
suggest we meet up every day,

00:36:56.165 --> 00:36:59.575
but I couldn't go out all the time, leaving you alone at home.

00:36:59.875 --> 00:37:01.305
You can, Mother.

00:37:01.705 --> 00:37:03.305
Meet your friends every day.

00:37:18.455 --> 00:37:21.255

(Huiyeon Daycare)

00:37:40.415 --> 00:37:41.515
- Excuse me. - Yes?

00:37:41.875 --> 00:37:43.745
Can I ask for a favour?

00:37:45.215 --> 00:37:47.755
I have to send this resume by email,

00:37:47.755 --> 00:37:49.655
but I don't know how to attach this.

00:37:49.855 --> 00:37:51.225
Can you help me?

00:37:52.025 --> 00:37:53.455
I'll say this again,

00:37:53.455 --> 00:37:55.355
but you can't give out two sheets at once.

00:37:55.595 --> 00:37:56.695
You can't throw them away either.

00:37:56.695 --> 00:37:57.765
Sure.

(Specialising in Korean cuisine)

00:38:47.375 --> 00:38:48.415
Hello?

00:38:49.445 --> 00:38:50.915
Yes, you've reached Eunoism Design.

00:38:52.145 --> 00:38:53.455
An estimate?

00:38:54.355 --> 00:38:55.615
Until the day after tomorrow?

00:38:58.125 --> 00:39:00.555
Can you send me the floor plan and your requests...

00:39:00.555 --> 00:39:02.255
via email right now?

00:39:02.965 --> 00:39:04.665
- She's taking on a new client? - Sure.

00:39:05.065 --> 00:39:06.495
Is she trying to kill herself from exhaustion?

00:39:07.495 --> 00:39:08.595
How foolish.

00:39:08.595 --> 00:39:10.435
Here's my email address. Oh, gosh.

00:39:10.865 --> 00:39:12.035
Just a second.

00:39:14.835 --> 00:39:15.905
Here.

00:39:16.775 --> 00:39:19.545
Thanks. Sure, go ahead.

00:39:27.755 --> 00:39:30.385
I'll give the handkerchief back washed.

00:39:32.255 --> 00:39:33.325
That you should.

00:39:33.755 --> 00:39:35.525
I can wrap things up here,

00:39:35.525 --> 00:39:36.865
so get some rest today.

00:39:37.825 --> 00:39:38.865
Why?

00:39:39.195 --> 00:39:41.095
I know about flooring too.

00:39:41.595 --> 00:39:43.135
I'm not a complete amateur, you know.

00:39:44.265 --> 00:39:46.235
That's only what you think.

00:39:47.205 --> 00:39:49.105
You might trust yourself,

00:39:49.105 --> 00:39:51.005
but I don't trust you.

00:39:51.005 --> 00:39:53.275
It's a coordinator's duty...

00:39:53.275 --> 00:39:55.675
to make sure the job is done well.

00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:58.945
Sure. Whatever.

00:40:04.125 --> 00:40:06.555
How stubborn can she be? Could she be more frustrating?

00:40:06.555 --> 00:40:07.825
I shouldn't have hired her as a coordinator.

00:40:09.965 --> 00:40:11.395
I was wondering how Eun Oh was doing.

00:40:11.995 --> 00:40:13.595
I'm in the dark too.

00:40:13.595 --> 00:40:15.665
I'm curious too, but I know I shouldn't call her.

00:40:16.835 --> 00:40:17.965
She must be at a site.

00:40:18.405 --> 00:40:19.475
Of course.

00:40:19.475 --> 00:40:21.675
Even if the world ends, she won't abandon her duties.

00:40:23.075 --> 00:40:25.375
All right. I got it for now.

00:40:29.785 --> 00:40:31.215
Here. I'll call you when your order's ready.

00:40:31.215 --> 00:40:32.685
- Thank you. - No problem.

00:40:33.515 --> 00:40:34.515
What?

00:40:35.385 --> 00:40:37.655
Director Seong Jae, Eun Oh won't be back for a while.

00:40:39.295 --> 00:40:40.395
I got this for her,

00:40:41.025 --> 00:40:42.295
but don't tell her it's from me.

00:40:42.925 --> 00:40:44.225
Let's say it's from you instead.

00:40:44.795 --> 00:40:46.635
These are cheongsimhwan and some supplements.

00:40:47.865 --> 00:40:49.505
I bet she's still in shock.

00:40:52.065 --> 00:40:54.135
Got it. I'll take credit for this.

00:40:55.635 --> 00:40:58.445
By the way, is Ji Hyuk at the site with her?

00:40:59.075 --> 00:41:00.175
Probably.

00:41:00.445 --> 00:41:01.975
He's there as a worker...

00:41:01.975 --> 00:41:03.515
and stays behind to clean everything up.

00:41:05.085 --> 00:41:07.485
Seong Jae. I have my own plan.

00:41:08.055 --> 00:41:09.525
I want to make it without anyone's help.

00:41:09.685 --> 00:41:13.355
How can a business succeed when you hardly prepared?

00:41:13.355 --> 00:41:14.525
It was only a few months.

00:41:15.555 --> 00:41:17.195
You really think less of me, don't you?

00:41:17.295 --> 00:41:20.265
I don't need help from you, my parents,

00:41:21.035 --> 00:41:23.065
or anyone else. Succeed or fail,

00:41:23.205 --> 00:41:24.505
I'll do it on my own.

00:41:25.105 --> 00:41:26.435
He's on-site as the handyman.

00:41:27.235 --> 00:41:28.505
Was he serious about this business?

00:41:32.775 --> 00:41:33.845
Right, then.

00:41:58.865 --> 00:42:00.305
Goodness me.

00:42:01.435 --> 00:42:02.545
Seriously?

00:42:02.805 --> 00:42:03.845
Are you out of your mind?

00:42:03.845 --> 00:42:05.875
Gosh, sorry about that.

00:42:07.845 --> 00:42:09.885
Wait, aren't you Sang Cheol?

00:42:10.815 --> 00:42:13.485
Are you Dong Gu? Choi Dong Gu?

00:42:13.485 --> 00:42:15.785
What a weird twist of events.

00:42:15.785 --> 00:42:18.155
Who knew I'd run into my high school friend like this?

00:42:19.195 --> 00:42:20.225
My gosh.

00:42:24.865 --> 00:42:26.035
It must've been rough.

00:42:26.665 --> 00:42:29.335
Right after retirement, you were pushed into the blizzard.

00:42:29.705 --> 00:42:31.035
What about you?

00:42:31.205 --> 00:42:33.005
Why are you working as a courier...

00:42:33.005 --> 00:42:34.675
when you retired as a bank manager?

00:42:35.175 --> 00:42:37.205
Were you scammed out of your retirement money?

00:42:38.305 --> 00:42:40.745
Yes, by my son.

00:42:41.475 --> 00:42:43.485
After finishing his studies abroad,

00:42:43.485 --> 00:42:44.985
he asked me for money to start a business,

00:42:44.985 --> 00:42:46.415
and I couldn't refuse.

00:42:47.855 --> 00:42:48.985
Isn't it ironic,

00:42:49.585 --> 00:42:50.725
since I was the one...

00:42:50.725 --> 00:42:52.555
who told everyone not to give their children money?

00:42:53.695 --> 00:42:56.865
For us, children are always the exception.

00:42:57.895 --> 00:42:58.895
By the way,

00:42:59.165 --> 00:43:00.235
it would've been a disaster...

00:43:00.235 --> 00:43:01.995
if you had gotten hurt because of me.

00:43:02.535 --> 00:43:03.905
Tell me about it.

00:43:03.905 --> 00:43:06.335
My wife and kids don't know I've been working this job.

00:43:06.775 --> 00:43:09.245
I've been lying to them, saying I have money stashed away.

00:43:09.845 --> 00:43:12.205
They think I spend time at a friend's office.

00:43:13.675 --> 00:43:15.745
How did your life get like this?

00:43:17.585 --> 00:43:19.415
I could tell you were new...

00:43:19.415 --> 00:43:21.715
at handing out flyers, seeing how awkward you were.

00:43:21.815 --> 00:43:24.725
It's not as if I can work a regular part-time job.

00:43:25.425 --> 00:43:26.425
Hey,

00:43:27.325 --> 00:43:28.795
back in high school,

00:43:29.295 --> 00:43:31.725
we both got good grades and were elected head of the class.

00:43:33.095 --> 00:43:36.165
Who knew we'd end up like this in our later years?

00:43:37.135 --> 00:43:40.305
Tell me about it. Life is such a battle.

00:43:42.305 --> 00:43:43.505
How are your parents?

00:43:44.305 --> 00:43:47.015
My father passed away three years ago,

00:43:47.015 --> 00:43:48.575
and my mother lives with me.

00:43:49.945 --> 00:43:51.215
I heard...

00:43:51.615 --> 00:43:54.085
how your father was injured on a fishing boat.

00:43:54.955 --> 00:43:56.285
Was it about 30 years ago?

00:43:56.855 --> 00:43:58.885
My father went out to fish with your father.

00:43:59.755 --> 00:44:01.195
- Really? - Yes.

00:44:01.195 --> 00:44:04.765
It was so long ago that I hardly remember.

00:44:06.835 --> 00:44:08.235
By the way,

00:44:08.865 --> 00:44:11.565
how long have you supported your parents?

00:44:20.515 --> 00:44:21.715
(2 sundaeguk, 20 dollars)

00:44:24.385 --> 00:44:26.455
Hey, let's each pay for our own meal.

00:44:26.455 --> 00:44:27.585
We're in the same situation now,

00:44:27.585 --> 00:44:29.325
and paying for each other's meals is a thing of the past.

00:44:34.895 --> 00:44:36.025
We'll pay the bill, please.

00:44:37.574 --> 00:44:38.644
Just a moment.

00:44:38.744 --> 00:44:40.514
The homeowner will come by much later.

00:44:40.514 --> 00:44:42.154
I texted them, so they'll wire the money.

00:44:42.284 --> 00:44:43.584
Can you clean up for me?

00:44:44.484 --> 00:44:45.554
Hello?

00:44:45.784 --> 00:44:47.384
I'll send you an estimate within two days.

00:44:48.124 --> 00:44:49.454
Yes, I got the email.

00:44:49.454 --> 00:44:52.324
She'll go to the Mapo site and then give someone an estimate?

00:44:52.694 --> 00:44:53.694
What the...

00:44:54.094 --> 00:44:55.494
Is she trying to work herself to death?

00:44:56.564 --> 00:44:58.004
Oh, whatever.

00:44:58.704 --> 00:45:00.204
I shouldn't have opened my office in the cafe.

00:45:00.804 --> 00:45:02.334
Just wait until I get an investment.

00:45:02.334 --> 00:45:03.874
I can't stand watching her do this.

00:45:06.944 --> 00:45:09.514
Why play the miserable heroine and get on my nerves?

00:45:10.614 --> 00:45:13.014
- Get everything that's inside. - Okay.

00:45:13.384 --> 00:45:14.484
Hello.

00:45:18.924 --> 00:45:20.624
- I'm here. - Hi.

00:45:20.854 --> 00:45:21.994
Ms. Ji.

00:45:22.894 --> 00:45:25.794
It's been just a day, and you look haggard.

00:45:26.124 --> 00:45:27.394
Oh, really?

00:45:27.894 --> 00:45:29.394
I must've tossed and turned...

00:45:29.394 --> 00:45:31.094
for fear that you'd tear everything down.

00:45:31.094 --> 00:45:32.164
What?

00:45:33.164 --> 00:45:34.974
Take a look around.

00:45:35.104 --> 00:45:36.134
- I will. - Go on.

00:45:42.244 --> 00:45:43.844
Should I get her some medicine to calm her down?

00:45:44.784 --> 00:45:46.884
Her brother's taunts were enough to scare even a grown man.

00:45:49.254 --> 00:45:50.884
(Mansaeng Pharmacy)

00:45:50.884 --> 00:45:51.954
Forget it.

00:45:53.154 --> 00:45:55.054
She won't take anything I get her.

00:45:57.794 --> 00:45:58.894
I'll get Su Jeong to give it to her.

00:46:02.064 --> 00:46:03.094
Wait.

00:46:03.764 --> 00:46:04.904
The flooring goes down today.

00:46:06.264 --> 00:46:07.874
The project finishes in three days.

00:46:07.974 --> 00:46:10.274
Lee Ji Hyuk. You birdbrain.

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:13.544
You have to pay her 18,000 dollars.

00:46:13.704 --> 00:46:16.174
You proudly said you'd pay her 20,000 dollars.

(Sunny Investment Support Center)

00:46:32.124 --> 00:46:33.264
Hello.

00:46:33.464 --> 00:46:35.964
Mamdaerozip's business proposal and investment request...

00:46:36.034 --> 00:46:37.594
cleared the first round.

00:46:37.694 --> 00:46:38.964
Hey, Sunny.

00:46:39.434 --> 00:46:40.834
Why are you so lazy?

00:46:41.604 --> 00:46:43.274
You're telling me this now?

00:46:46.044 --> 00:46:47.074
Yes.

00:46:47.274 --> 00:46:49.344
I pitched to two places. One of them will approve a loan.

00:46:49.874 --> 00:46:51.514
Yes. It'll work out.

00:46:51.984 --> 00:46:52.984
It will.

00:46:55.954 --> 00:46:57.014
Hello.

00:46:57.754 --> 00:46:59.784
I won't stay here tonight. Be sure to lock up.

00:46:59.854 --> 00:47:00.954
Why won't you...

00:47:01.594 --> 00:47:03.594
I won't be here tonight. Lock things up.

00:47:05.194 --> 00:47:07.194
Where will he sleep if not here?

00:47:07.964 --> 00:47:09.294
Does he have another girlfriend?

00:47:10.234 --> 00:47:11.404
Goodness...

00:47:17.204 --> 00:47:18.274
I'm back.

00:47:19.874 --> 00:47:21.004
Eun Oh.

00:47:23.414 --> 00:47:25.444
Don't give me that look. I feel uncomfortable.

00:47:26.084 --> 00:47:27.084
You brat.

00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:29.314
Did you and Ji Hyuk argue again?

00:47:29.314 --> 00:47:30.684
Why come in separately but just seconds apart?

00:47:31.214 --> 00:47:32.924
I'm coming from the Mapo site.

00:47:33.184 --> 00:47:35.524
The guy in our storage room was at his site all day long.

00:47:35.994 --> 00:47:37.054
Ji Eun Oh.

00:47:37.154 --> 00:47:39.624
I was going to buy myself an oat milk latte.

00:47:39.624 --> 00:47:41.024
I'll buy you one too.

00:47:42.894 --> 00:47:43.934
Okay.

00:47:44.364 --> 00:47:45.604
Did you hear that? Two lattes.

00:47:45.804 --> 00:47:46.834
Two lattes.

00:47:52.874 --> 00:47:54.004
How did things go yesterday?

00:47:54.944 --> 00:47:57.474
Sorry, Su Jeong. I have work to do.

00:47:58.044 --> 00:48:00.544
Hey. Can you not be so indifferent?

00:48:00.644 --> 00:48:02.184
Do I mean this little to you?

00:48:02.884 --> 00:48:04.684
I'm really busy today.

00:48:04.884 --> 00:48:06.184
Someone asked for an estimate.

00:48:07.254 --> 00:48:09.054
- You'll do it? - Yes.

00:48:12.624 --> 00:48:14.794
You can work here all night, then.

00:48:15.394 --> 00:48:17.534
Ji Hyuk won't sleep here tonight.

00:48:17.534 --> 00:48:18.834
He told me to lock up.

00:48:20.904 --> 00:48:21.904
Did he?

00:48:23.774 --> 00:48:25.004
I'll give you a call.

It's Mamdaerozip.

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:02.514
I read your post.

00:49:08.254 --> 00:49:09.284
Who is it?

00:49:14.424 --> 00:49:16.594
I came to get the mat and my sleeping bag.

00:49:18.194 --> 00:49:19.224
They're over here.

Hey.

00:49:43.584 --> 00:49:44.684
You must take something.

00:49:47.854 --> 00:49:48.924
Cheongsimhwan?

00:49:49.294 --> 00:49:50.624
Where did you get this?

00:49:51.224 --> 00:49:52.264
I bought it.

00:49:53.764 --> 00:49:54.864
And this supplement...

00:49:54.864 --> 00:49:57.234
was my mom's gift from my sister-in-law,

00:49:57.534 --> 00:49:59.264
but it doesn't suit my mom.

00:49:59.264 --> 00:50:01.234
I was going to sell it online,

00:50:01.334 --> 00:50:03.704
- but you can have it. - Okay.

00:50:04.074 --> 00:50:05.744
Thanks a lot for looking out for me.

00:50:10.974 --> 00:50:12.044
It's bitter.

00:50:13.884 --> 00:50:15.214
She's doing just fine.

00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:23.794
Did you get her the cheongsimhwan?

Hello, I'm Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:51:38.034 --> 00:51:39.864
Ji Wan, can you play something else?

00:51:40.404 --> 00:51:41.434
Oh, I forgot.

00:51:41.534 --> 00:51:43.334
I played this on my way to pick you up.

Thanks.

00:51:46.444 --> 00:51:47.504
Sure.

Yeong Ra. You don't have to go anywhere today.

After I drop you off,

00:51:52.544 --> 00:51:55.054
can I run some errands for 3 or 4 hours?

00:51:55.884 --> 00:51:57.014
I don't know.

00:51:57.684 --> 00:51:59.724
There's no guarantee Mom won't want to see me.

00:52:00.384 --> 00:52:01.694
Is that a no?

00:52:02.224 --> 00:52:03.824
I'm saying I don't know.

00:52:06.264 --> 00:52:08.694
Why doesn't your mother give a heads-up?

00:52:09.034 --> 00:52:10.194
You're a grown woman.

00:52:10.634 --> 00:52:13.164
She gives me something to do out of the blue...

00:52:13.304 --> 00:52:14.664
for my sake.

00:52:14.974 --> 00:52:16.204
Whatever.

00:52:16.734 --> 00:52:19.004
I have something important to do,

00:52:19.074 --> 00:52:20.874
so I'll do it after I drop you off.

00:52:21.304 --> 00:52:22.814
Don't I have a life too?

00:52:23.114 --> 00:52:25.144
I work from 9 to 9, get 50 minutes for lunch,

00:52:25.144 --> 00:52:26.184
and work weekends too.

00:52:26.884 --> 00:52:28.254
I get one weekday off a week.

00:52:28.614 --> 00:52:30.184
I can't see my friends at all.

00:52:32.124 --> 00:52:33.184
I guess not.

00:52:33.854 --> 00:52:35.524
You never go anywhere.

00:52:36.094 --> 00:52:38.154
I know your exhibition's coming up.

00:52:39.364 --> 00:52:40.424
Isn't it suffocating?

00:52:40.964 --> 00:52:42.034
It's not.

00:52:42.264 --> 00:52:43.534
How come?

00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:45.464
Don't you want to see your friends?

00:52:46.564 --> 00:52:47.564
Not really.

00:52:51.704 --> 00:52:54.344
Just because everyone else spends time with friends,

00:52:54.344 --> 00:52:55.874
it doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.

00:52:57.244 --> 00:52:58.484
There are exceptions...

00:52:58.684 --> 00:53:01.084
and special circumstances, you see.

00:53:02.254 --> 00:53:04.384
Do you need a reason to see a friend?

00:53:04.784 --> 00:53:06.884
A friend is just a friend.

00:53:08.894 --> 00:53:11.694
You must have friends.

00:53:13.094 --> 00:53:15.994
The definition of "friend" depends on the person.

00:53:16.234 --> 00:53:18.834
My gosh. You're so frustrating.

00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:22.804
Ji Wan. Focus on the road.

00:53:55.034 --> 00:53:56.074
I'm off.

00:53:59.304 --> 00:54:00.604

Then...

00:54:08.284 --> 00:54:10.214

00:54:10.214 --> 00:54:12.584

00:54:33.144 --> 00:54:35.074
Here. This is delicious chocolate.

00:54:35.314 --> 00:54:37.674
It's chocolate. You're the best.

00:54:45.284 --> 00:54:46.884
Seong Jae!

00:54:46.884 --> 00:54:49.954
Ji Hyuk stole my gummy!

00:54:52.064 --> 00:54:54.194
I'll buy you something more delicious.

00:54:55.294 --> 00:54:56.394
Let's go.

00:55:02.534 --> 00:55:04.604
Su Bin falls asleep whenever you carry her on your back.

00:55:08.544 --> 00:55:09.614
- My goodness. - My goodness.

00:55:09.614 --> 00:55:11.274
- It looks so good. - It must be delicious.

00:55:11.274 --> 00:55:12.484
Thank you, Seong Jae.

00:55:12.484 --> 00:55:14.044
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:55:16.384 --> 00:55:17.914
Enjoy it.

00:55:18.584 --> 00:55:20.424
Seong Jae, do you like living in the US?

00:55:20.424 --> 00:55:21.894
I wish I could go there too.

00:55:22.824 --> 00:55:24.024
Isn't this delicious?

00:55:24.024 --> 00:55:25.494
- Yes, it's good. - I like it.

00:55:29.934 --> 00:55:32.264
This is why Seong Jae thinks of me as a little kid.

00:55:33.004 --> 00:55:34.204
I'd feel the same if I were him.

00:55:39.144 --> 00:55:40.374
- Su Bin. - Yes?

00:55:42.474 --> 00:55:44.314
What do you think? Don't I look good?

00:55:54.154 --> 00:55:56.124
(Sexy black)

00:55:56.124 --> 00:55:57.354
(Romantic yellow)

00:55:57.354 --> 00:55:59.064
(Lovely blue)

00:55:59.064 --> 00:56:00.164
This isn't it.

00:56:00.964 --> 00:56:03.094
Gosh, what should I wear?

00:56:08.334 --> 00:56:12.174
(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

00:56:12.344 --> 00:56:15.414
(Lee Su Bin)

00:56:16.574 --> 00:56:17.674
Hey, Su Bin.

00:56:19.784 --> 00:56:20.844
Do you want to meet up?

00:56:21.384 --> 00:56:23.314
You told me to call you if anything happened.

00:56:24.114 --> 00:56:26.784
What's wrong? Did something happen at home?

00:56:26.984 --> 00:56:29.454
No. I have something to discuss.

00:56:29.994 --> 00:56:31.454
I'm not asking for a favour.

00:56:31.454 --> 00:56:32.764
We need to meet and talk.

00:56:33.324 --> 00:56:34.494
Really?

00:56:37.334 --> 00:56:38.904
All right. When do you want to meet?

00:57:03.994 --> 00:57:06.264
Well... Hello.

00:57:08.294 --> 00:57:10.094
Oh, hello!

00:57:10.094 --> 00:57:12.664
I'm CEO Lee Ji Hyuk's brother, Lee Ji Wan.

00:57:12.664 --> 00:57:13.834
Nice to meet you.

00:57:13.834 --> 00:57:15.304
I see. Nice to meet you.

00:57:15.574 --> 00:57:17.004
- Lee Ji Wan! - Ji Hyuk.

00:57:21.574 --> 00:57:22.574
Come here.

00:57:26.314 --> 00:57:29.154
A businessman should look stylish.

00:57:29.414 --> 00:57:31.554
When you have those fancy clothes and shoes,

00:57:32.124 --> 00:57:33.754
why are you wearing the cheap ones?

00:57:35.724 --> 00:57:38.724
I was going to wear that to the investment pitch tomorrow.

00:57:38.724 --> 00:57:39.894
Really?

00:57:40.664 --> 00:57:41.994
Do I have the power to foresee the future?

00:57:42.434 --> 00:57:44.334
Ji Wan, how did you bring all these?

00:57:44.334 --> 00:57:47.664
I just brought them without anyone knowing.

00:57:49.904 --> 00:57:53.304
You know when to use your brain. You're useful, Ji Wan.

00:57:53.304 --> 00:57:55.314
It's not like I'm always clumsy.

00:57:55.314 --> 00:57:56.744
By the way, where's the dry cleaner?

00:57:56.744 --> 00:57:58.744
We should have these clothes ironed.

00:57:58.744 --> 00:57:59.784
They got wrinkled on my way here.

00:57:59.784 --> 00:58:01.244
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

00:58:02.354 --> 00:58:04.054
I'm so touched that I have to do something.

00:58:04.684 --> 00:58:05.724
Really?

00:58:05.884 --> 00:58:07.984
You'll be really surprised if you find this out.

00:58:08.384 --> 00:58:10.854
I even got you a car.

00:58:12.324 --> 00:58:13.324
My goodness.

00:58:20.164 --> 00:58:21.204
You're early.

00:58:21.564 --> 00:58:23.874
They're installing the windows, so I finished early.

00:58:24.274 --> 00:58:25.404
By the way, outside...

00:58:25.404 --> 00:58:27.344
Please take good care of my brother.

00:58:30.174 --> 00:58:31.274
Well...

00:58:33.184 --> 00:58:36.054
This is CEO Ji Eun Oh of Eunoism Design.

00:58:36.454 --> 00:58:38.314
I see. Nice to meet you.

00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:40.624
I'm the younger brother of CEO Lee Ji Hyuk of Mamdaerozip,

00:58:40.624 --> 00:58:42.024
Lee Ji Wan.

00:58:44.024 --> 00:58:45.524
I'm Ji Eun Oh.

00:58:48.894 --> 00:58:50.264
- Let's go. - Okay.

00:58:50.794 --> 00:58:52.934
- Please take good care of him. - Okay. Bye.

00:58:55.434 --> 00:58:57.174
He's very polite.

00:58:57.234 --> 00:58:58.644
He's nothing like his brother.

00:58:58.874 --> 00:59:00.874
I saw a car outside, and I wondered whose it was.

00:59:06.814 --> 00:59:08.714
I handwashed the car.

00:59:10.454 --> 00:59:12.784
Thank you. I'm really glad that you did this.

00:59:13.654 --> 00:59:16.754
By the way, I have something important to do today.

00:59:17.454 --> 00:59:19.024
I should get going.

00:59:19.024 --> 00:59:20.324
You know, I always have to be on standby.

00:59:20.624 --> 00:59:22.634
Right. By the way, Ji Wan...

00:59:22.634 --> 00:59:23.664
Come on.

00:59:24.434 --> 00:59:25.964
See you.

00:59:28.974 --> 00:59:30.034
Thanks.

00:59:33.104 --> 00:59:34.344
This saved my life.

00:59:35.444 --> 00:59:36.614
It's all good now.

00:59:37.044 --> 00:59:38.744
I'll pay Eun Oh on time.

00:59:38.744 --> 00:59:40.314
I don't need a bank.

00:59:42.714 --> 00:59:44.314
I was so worried.

00:59:44.684 --> 00:59:46.824

01:00:02.204 --> 01:00:03.304
- Hey. - My goodness.

01:00:03.834 --> 01:00:05.034
You're here again.

01:00:05.404 --> 01:00:07.004
You get more customers when I'm here.

01:00:08.474 --> 01:00:10.414
It's an order. I'll get that.

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:12.984
Hello, ma'am.

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:14.314
- I'll take this. - Oh, boy.

01:00:16.054 --> 01:00:17.314
(Mamdaerozip)

01:00:20.424 --> 01:00:22.924
Hello, everyone. I'm Lee Ji Hyuk from Mamdaerozip.

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:26.264
About DIY interior design...

01:00:26.894 --> 01:00:28.694
I'm CEO Lee Ji Hyuk of Mamdaerozip.

01:00:42.214 --> 01:00:43.914
Is it already this late?

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:19.144
What is he doing?

01:01:39.164 --> 01:01:41.334
(About interior design)

(Wood: raw material for pulp and construction)

01:02:00.654 --> 01:02:01.754
It's no business.

01:02:01.754 --> 01:02:02.854
He's just bluffing.

01:02:02.854 --> 01:02:04.524
Business is no joke.

01:02:04.524 --> 01:02:06.164
He can't launch that and a site in two months.

01:02:06.724 --> 01:02:09.164
If he were that capable, he'd have become a CEO long ago.

01:02:09.164 --> 01:02:10.664
Why did he work in an office?

01:02:19.474 --> 01:02:20.974
If I'm around...

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.474
If I'm in your space,

01:02:25.474 --> 01:02:26.744
will that kill you?

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:29.184
I will die.

(Our Golden Days)

01:03:49.944 --> 01:03:52.944
It feels like the feisty Lee Ji Hyuk has made his comeback.

01:03:53.114 --> 01:03:54.944
I'll invest in Mamdaerozip.

01:03:54.944 --> 01:03:56.144
Don't you think it's a bluff?

01:03:56.144 --> 01:03:57.744
Why would you care about that when you run a business?

01:03:57.944 --> 01:03:58.944
Let's go, Seong Jae.

01:03:58.944 --> 01:04:01.454
Linking arms is no big deal between us.

01:04:01.454 --> 01:04:02.854
Why does he keep nagging?

01:04:03.454 --> 01:04:05.054
How dare he lecture me?

01:04:05.154 --> 01:04:06.824
Why do you keep criticizing what I do?

01:04:06.954 --> 01:04:09.964
Ji Eun Oh, I might be someone you resent forever,

01:04:09.964 --> 01:04:11.264
but you're still simply Ji Eun Oh to me.

01:04:11.764 --> 01:04:13.434
Eun Oh, are you all right?

01:04:14.164 --> 01:04:16.734
If you don't give me the money, you'll be kicked out of this house.

01:04:17.004 --> 01:04:20.034
Ji Eun Oh, whose child are you to be this shameless?

01:04:20.604 --> 01:04:22.034
Who are your real parents?
