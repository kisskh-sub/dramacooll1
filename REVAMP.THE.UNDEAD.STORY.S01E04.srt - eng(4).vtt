00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.200
So, did you get the solid proof you were looking for?

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.200
I’ll become the most pitiful vampire

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.600
if you decide to leave me in the end.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.680
I’ll stay here with you.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.040
IT’S TIME FOR YOU TO DEAL WITH THE TARGET.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.200
(It’s been over a week)

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.200
(since I accepted the mission from Jett.)

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.120
This will be the last one.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.080
After this,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.520
I promise I won’t bother you again.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.080
(Punn, you said you’ve seen
the necklace before.)

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.080
(If your memory is correct,
I think it was him that night.)

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.200
(Like Master said, you’re the only one
who can break his curse.)

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.200
Ouch!

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.280
Ouch!

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.880
(My mission is to kill you.)

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.960
Hey.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.440
Punn!

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.760
I’m fine.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.079
I’ll always protect you

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.680
for as long as you want me to.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.720
(But right now, the way I feel about you)

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.640
(has changed.)

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.720
Do vampires not usually wear
proper pajamas?

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.040
Aren’t you cold?

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.640
I’m not cold.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.400
Are you?

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.480
Of course, I’m cold.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.600
Let me help

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.560
make you warm.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.320
Hey!

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.680
Hey!

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.720
Thanks for deciding to stay here with me.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.760
Hey,

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.080
I’m going home for a bit.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.920
I need to take care of something.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.600
I’m not running away.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.600
I’ll be back as soon as I can.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.600
Hey.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.680
Hey.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
You’re unbelievable.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.120
Alright, I’ll let you go home.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.120
But promise me you’ll come back.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.440
I’ll be waiting.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.640
Okay.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.880
You can play, but be gentle, okay?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.000
WINNALA ANTIQUE BUYING, SELLING,
REPAIR & CONSERVATION

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.840
CONTACT ME WHEN YOU GET HOME.
I’M WORRIED ABOUT YOU. - PONG

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.000
IT’S TIME FOR YOU
TO DEAL WITH THE TARGET.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.280
JETT, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU GUYS.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.480
LET’S MEET AT ORION.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.040
You take good care of these flowers, Master.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.440
Punn likes roses. When he comes back and sees them, he should be in a good mood.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.720
Where is he?

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.480
He went home to take care of something.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.800
By the way, Methus,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.880
I’m thinking of expanding the flower garden to cover the whole rooftop.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.120
Punn told me he wanted a house
with a big flower garden.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.280
You like him very much, don’t you?

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.320
You know the answer, Methus.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:11.560
If he weren’t the one who broke your curse, would you still like him?

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.440
Of course, I chose him myself.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.840
Master.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.080
I’m just thinking

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.440
maybe you should consider what Ciar said

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.960
about Mr. Punn.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.600
Methus.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.880
Of everyone around me, I trust you the most.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.520
Please don’t turn into another Ciar.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.360
This should be enough
to make Master believe

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.840
that Punn is really one of the Hunters.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.120
Hey, what are you doing?

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.240
I’m going to tell Master about this myself.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.600
You guys stay put.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.200
But…

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.480
Let Methus handle it.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.320
Master listens to him the most.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.080
Got it.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:34.800
When you have time, can you find some more beautiful roses to add to the garden?

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.040
Of course, Master.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.080
Master is crazy about that human?

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.920
Huginn, Muminn,

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.760
keep a close eye on Punn and the Hunters.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.080
There’s no way you can escape
my raven eyes.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.320
Knock, knock.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.440
What, Doctor?

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.280
Did you finish all the jelly candy I gave you?

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.840
Why are you smoking again?

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.880
You only gave me a little.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.080
Of course, I already finished it.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.760
How about this?

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.360
I’ll buy you a lot more,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.800
so you won’t have to smoke again.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.280
There’s no need.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.400
I threw that away for you.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.160
Great.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.640
By the way, did you just get here for work?

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.120
Yes, I’m on the late-night shift.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.960
What about you, Pokpong?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.360
I’m about to clock out.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.080
Doctor…

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.520
Can I get your advice on something?

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.200
Do you have any siblings?

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.000
Hmm.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.920
You could say that. Why do you ask?

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.240
I had a fight with my older brother
and it seems like he’s been avoiding me.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.680
Actually, we don’t live together.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.480
Our parents died when we were young.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.200
A foster family took me in,

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.120
but my brother had to live in an orphanage.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.120
We were separated
until we reconnected recently.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.600
But it seems like
he’s hiding something from me

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.000
and I can’t really get through to him.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.440
I think I get it.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:51.320
The feeling of not knowing who you are
and not knowing where you belong.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.560
Living with your family doesn’t feel right,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.200
but living with your brother
isn’t the answer either.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.040
Whoa. You read my mind.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.040
Are you a doctor or a fortune teller?

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:09.960
Let’s just say you’re not the only one
who feels that way.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.480
Me too.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:16.680
Do you want to talk about it?

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.800
Maybe another time.
My night shift starts soon.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.440
Anyway,

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.800
if I were your brother,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.160
I’d want you to be able to
share your feelings with me.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.400
Why don’t you try telling him how you feel?

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.880
Talk to him with reason
and listen to him with reason too.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.840
That’ll help you open up more easily.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.800
He’s your brother, after all.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.680
Keep me posted.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.040
I will.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.480
Hey, here you are, handsome.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.080
What happened here?

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.960
The vampire named Ciar invaded.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.160
What? Why haven’t I heard anything?

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.800
We tried reaching out to you several times,

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.240
but your phone was off.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.000
Yeah.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.480
We get it, though.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.760
You’re infiltrating the enemy.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.240
Understandable.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.720
You must have no time to answer calls.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.680
We get it.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.800
By the way,

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.440
I guess you asked us to meet here

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:53.160
because you have updates
about their powers?

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:54.960
Do you?

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.040
At least a bit?

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.880
Look at that face.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.200
- Silence.
- I guess not then.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.120
After you sent us info about Methus,

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.800
I already made the bullets.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.640
The ones to reduce speed.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.280
Please! Speed, my ass!

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.920
Don’t listen to him, Punn.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.800
His bullets couldn’t even slow them down
for 10 seconds.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.520
If vampires were old people,
they’d still walk faster than that.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.040
How do they walk?

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.520
Where’s Jett?

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.240
Oh, he’s in his office.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.080
He and Elise are waiting for you.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.840
Ouch!

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.960
He’s so strong.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.120
He almost broke my shoulder.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.720
Let’s go.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.520
Yeah.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.360
Where’s Jett?

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:32.960
What?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.840
Where’s Jett?

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.800
Come on.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.040
Where’s Jett?

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.840
Just say it, Punn.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.840
You wanted to see all of us today

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.280
because you have something important
to tell us, right?

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.200
I’m withdrawing from the mission.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:06.920
Huh?

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.280
What do you mean?

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.040
Did they catch you?

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:12.880
No.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.840
I don’t want to do it anymore.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.480
I don’t want to lie.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.560
I don’t want to kill anyone anymore.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.600
No, Punn.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.520
We agreed on this, remember?

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.600
You can get that close to our target.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.520
Only you can finish the mission.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.200
You can’t back out like this.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.160
I’m sorry, Elise.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.960
So you’ve been hesitating

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.320
and stalling for time all along because of this.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.440
Did you forget

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.080
what they did?

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.960
That was 10 years ago.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.400
You can’t use that

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.440
to force everyone to do what you want.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.480
Jett!

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.080
Jett!

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.720
Let me remind you, Punn.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.400
Just that night alone,

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.480
they killed the people we love.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.000
They killed our family.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.480
They almost killed me,

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.120
Elise,

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.640
and you too.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.680
Do you still think I’m demanding, huh?

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.480
Stop!

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.480
Jett, that’s enough!

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.160
Enough, both of you!

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.160
If you’re still hesitating like this,

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.000
then you’re not fit for the mission.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.120
You’re just going to end up dead.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
We’ll take it from here.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.160
You can leave and go be with your brother.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.400
Don’t ever come back here.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.000
Get up, Master. Come with me.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.120
Where are you taking him?

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.280
I’m going to make him see for himself

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.520
that Punn is really part of the group
that’s trying to kill him.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.080
Wait, Punn.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.520
Please don’t be mad at Jett.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.280
He didn’t want to drag you back into this.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:44.320
He knows you want to quit
because Pokpong is moving in with you.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.720
We tried using Paul and Caster,

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.720
but the mission failed.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.480
I’m the one who asked Jett
to bring you back.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.440
You might think this is silly,

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.200
but what happened that night
is still stuck in my mind.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:13.720
I still have bad dreams every night about you and me hiding from them under the bed.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.720
You know what, Punn?

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.520
What happened that night

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.560
feels like it just happened yesterday.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:29.920
If they’re still alive, who knows who else would have to go through what we did?

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.640
I don’t want it to happen again.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.240
I don’t want anyone to experience loss,

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.480
and I don’t want to lose anyone again.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.120
This is made from the info you gave us.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.720
I know you don’t want to kill anyone,

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.160
but we don’t have to kill all the vampires,

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.160
I just need you to kill one!

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:12.240
If you can deal with the last descendant
of Jonoel, it’ll all be over, Punn.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.600
You’ll get to live a normal life.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.080
You’ll get to live with Pokpong
without having to hide who you are.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.120
I’m not going.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.280
You wanted me to find proof, didn’t you?

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.120
I’m taking you to see it with your own eyes.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.640
That human has been lying to you.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.280
I’ll wait for Punn here.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.680
I trust him.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.560
You’re just…

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.080
so obsessed with that human,

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.760
you’ve become deaf and blind
to everything else.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.680
Let go!

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.880
Where are you going?

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.120
I don’t know.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.240
If they want to kill our Master,

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.400
I’m going to kill them first.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.880
I’m not going to sit around like you.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.440
But our Master doesn’t allow us
to kill humans.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.400
Use your own brain for a change, Methus.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.880
You don’t have to act like a butler
and follow his orders all the time.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.080
Watch your mouth.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.800
Don’t make me lose it and break your neck.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.440
Fine, I hear you.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.320
Let go of me.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.040
What do we do next?

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.160
I just need you to kill one!

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:10.760
If you can deal with the last descendant
of Jonoel, it’ll all be over.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.680
You’ll get to live a normal life.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.200
You’ll get to live with Pokpong
without having to hide who you are.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.080
Pong.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.760
Where have you been?

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.560
I texted you that I went on a work trip
to another city.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.840
I have to go to work now.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.280
Is everything okay?

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.200
Have you gone home at all?

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.680
Don’t call them.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.400
I just want to talk to you nicely today.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.880
All this time, I’ve been acting like a mess

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.880
because I want my new family to leave me.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.040
I never saw them as my family.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.160
You’re my only family, Punn.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.880
But I didn’t consider that you might be uncomfortable about me moving in.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.240
Every time I try to get close to you,

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.960
you try to avoid me.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.400
It’s not like that, Pong.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:28.080
I’m not uncomfortable. I just have a reason.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.880
It’s not that I don’t want to live with you.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.440
I promise I’ll listen to your reason carefully.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.480
No, Pong.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:54.560
My only reason is I don’t want you
to get involved in the things I do.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.560
Once I’ve dealt with everything,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.600
we can talk about this again.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.120
I thought if I opened up to you,

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.400
you’d do the same.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.200
I guess I was wrong.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:19.800
Pong!

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.600
It’s okay.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.120
This reminds me of the first day I met you.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.280
You didn’t even know
how to eat instant noodles back then.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.720
But look at you now.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.040
You can even make them for me.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.200
This is the only dish I can make.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:33.120
Hmm…looking back, what made you
dare to let me into your house?

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.960
Weren’t you scared of me at all?

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.800
You’re not scary at all.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.440
And even if you’d thought of hurting me,

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.800
I’d have been able to fight back.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.160
What about now?

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.800
Are you scared of me?

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.720
I didn’t have my powers then,

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.280
but now I have them all back.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.120
No, if you really were going to hurt me,

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.320
you wouldn’t have made me instant noodles.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.680
Who knows?

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.360
I might’ve added poison to your bowl.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.120
Really?

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.240
Yeah.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.840
I didn’t add any!

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.000
I’m just kidding, Mr. Ramil.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.720
I’m glad to see you happy
when you’re with me.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.880
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.880
I don’t want to sleep alone.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.760
Come in.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.600
The roses still haven’t wilted?

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.520
I use my power to preserve them,

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.320
waiting for you to come back.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.680
Can I go up to the garden
tomorrow morning?

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.200
I’ll arrange new roses for you.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:13.760
Of course. You can go up there
anytime you want.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.520
You have my permission.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.240
Thank you.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
You should sleep.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.440
Aren’t you going to sleep?

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.080
I’d rather you sleep here.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.199
Hey.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.400
I’m cold.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.280
Good night, Punn.

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:37.640
3 MIRACULOUSLY SURVIVE FIRE THAT KILLED CHILDREN AND CAREGIVERS
AT MICHAEL ORPHANAGE

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.280
Punn, wake up!

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.040
Where’s Jett?

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.680
Let go of Jett!

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.800
What are you doing up here?

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.360
You couldn’t sleep?

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.120
Yeah, I couldn’t sleep.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.000
So I came to get some roses.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.640
I was planning to replace
the ones in your vase in the morning.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.200
Don’t avoid my eyes, Punn.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.440
I’m reading your mind.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:38.080
Let me feel and understand your pain.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.320
Let me help carry it.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.320
What happened to me last night?

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.040
Nothing.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.520
You just fell asleep in my arms.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.880
And you tossed and turned a bit.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.560
By the way,

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.640
why did you bring the vase in here?

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.880
Oh,

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:25.720
I told you last night I’d replace the flowers.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.560
I couldn’t really sleep,

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.320
so I went up to the rooftop garden,

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.840
cut some roses, and made a new arrangement for your vase.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.280
You went to the rooftop?

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.680
You were there with me, weren’t you?

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.720
Me?

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.360
Excuse me for a moment.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.360
Punn,

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.760
is something wrong?

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.080
Can I go up to the rooftop garden?

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.760
I want to cut some fresh roses
and replace the ones in your vase.

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.280
I don’t want to trouble you.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.560
Not at all.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.240
Please let me go up there.

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:03.880
Master, I want to talk to you
about something important.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.400
Privately.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.160
Ciar got this photo from the pub
where the Hunters gather.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.280
The owner of that pub is Mr. Jett,

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.320
He’s also the gallery owner who asked me to showcase the painting you were trapped in.

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:46.680
Actually, I’ve been suspicious of their connection, so I dug up more documents.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:01.800
The three of them are survivors
of a massacre,

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.080
which I think is linked to vampires.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:21.680
Ouch!

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.360
Aren’t you going to do something?

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.360
What else am I supposed to do, Methus?

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.640
I’ve done everything I can.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.200
Mr. Punn, what are you doing up here?

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.360
I came to get some flowers
to arrange in the vase for Mr. Ramil.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.320
Once you’re done,
please meet Master downstairs.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.640
He’s waiting for you.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.360
Okay.

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.400
Thank you

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.240
for releasing Master from the curse

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.120
and helping restore his four powers.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.720
Four?

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.400
That’s right.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.640
Apart from speed,

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.640
transformation,

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.840
and healing,

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.000
what's the other one?

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:59.240
The power that makes him
the strongest leader of the vampires.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.600
Mind reading.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.400
That’s what you’ve been looking for, isn’t it?

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:38.120
Tell me how you did it.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.960
You know who I am

00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.800
and why I approached you.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.600
I’d rather hear it from you.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.640
I’m one of the Hunters.

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.160
I hunt your Jonoel vampire lineage.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:26.160
My only goal in coming here is to kill you.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.080
In that case,

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.760
do what you have to do, Punn.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.280
Kill me.

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.160
I won’t run away or fight back.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.320
I’ll stand right here.

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.840
You’re willing to die for me?

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.160
Why?

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:15.840
All this time I’ve spent with you
has given me enough happiness.

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:20.640
If I have to die, I’ll have no regrets.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:27.840
If I have to die by your hands, I’m willing to.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.400
I came here to kill you,

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.320
but you still trust me
and let me stay by your side.

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:45.280
You’re so stupid for choosing to trust me.

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:54.680
Don’t hesitate, Punn.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:00.120
Kill me, so you can finally be free.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:13.800
Enough!

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.440
I really can’t do it.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.640
I really can’t kill you.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.120
You must’ve been hurting all along.

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:47.880
From now on, let me take care of your heart.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.360
I love you, Punn.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.320
I love you too, Mr. Ramil.

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:25.880
I spent time with you to sort out my own feelings.

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:31.600
If you don’t want to get involved in this anymore,

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.320
you must get over Ramil.
