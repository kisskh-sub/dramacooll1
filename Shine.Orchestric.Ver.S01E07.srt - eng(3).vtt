00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.499
Hey, don't!

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:26.379
I been groomin' them since mornin'.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:27.939
Hey.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.539
I need your help!

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.060
Who dared mess with you?

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.260
Who cares?

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.180
Just go and tear that jerk down.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.019
You got this, bro!

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.339
Just let him.

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:45.819
Calm down.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.260
How many times did you hurt him!?

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.419
How thick-skinned of you to go see him!?

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Hey Victor! What the fuck are you talking about?

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.100
You've got us all confused.

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:00.459
Why the fuck are you smiling, huh?

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:01.379
Don't!

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.339
Victor!

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.660
Victor, get out of the pool!

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.180
Hey!

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.300
Punches are quick...

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.339
the heart is queasy...

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.740
only booze can keep you sleeplessly...

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.740
"Fermenting heart, forgetting world"

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.580
Cheers!

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:14.939
It's so delicious, Auntie.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.180
Of course—it’s my cooking.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.499
But I helped you cook too!

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.300
Victor, you're home.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.700
Wow, what a crowd!

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.260
Uncle, do you want to tell Victor youself?

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.140
I've made it son.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.060
You mean..

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.819
They love my book

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.740
The U.S. press, Free Word,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.620
has agreed to publish Uncle Ivan's book.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.700
Free Word Press?

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.899
That's world class, Dad!

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.019
I'm proud of you, Dad!

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.339
The truth will finally be revealed!

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.260
I've made it son.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.459
I knew it! My husband is not just a plebeian.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.060
What did Uncle say, Auntie?

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.620
I don't know. I barely understood a word.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.620
Dang.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.419
I always knew he was capable. He’s always been.

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:15.899
And there's one more thing.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.620
We're moving to America?

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.140
They’ve offered you a full scholarship.

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:42.580
You can study as far as you want.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.580
Is this because of your book, Dad?

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.060
Yes.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.419
Since Uncle Ivan’s book exposes the Soviet dictatorship,

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.580
the U.S. government will arrange everything

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:56.819
to make sure Uncle Ivan and his family become U.S. citizens.

00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:02.459
Does that mean we’ll move to America for good?

00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:06.419
It's best for your future.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.459
That's what matters most to your mom and me.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.939
Yes. Yes.

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:18.740
And when are we going, Ran?

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:20.700
My friend said

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:22.660
you should go first,

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.019
to manage the documents for your dad.

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.100
He’ll take care of you.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.300
I’ll prepare travel documents for your mom and dad.

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:31.859
Have you finished your exams?

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.620
Yes.

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:36.580
But...

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:38.539
What's worrying you, son?

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.379
My friends... the ones who protest with me.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.060
They risked their lives for justice.

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.859
Should I leave them just like that?

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.019
You're not leaving anything behind.

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:03.419
Victor, you don't need to stay here to fight.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.740
Your father is making a huge contribution to his homeland

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.899
even though he's a thousand miles away.

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:15.379
And if you go there, learn as much as you can.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.539
Take every opportunity and come back

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:19.740
to make a real difference.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.459
That's true fighting.

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:26.620
Stop beating around the bush!

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.660
Victor,

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.660
the reason we need you to go first,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.660
is to speed up the process for me and your dad.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.379
Once the book's out, people will start recognizing him.

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:39.300
And we'll never know if the communists

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.979
will hunt him down.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.740
We need to leave quickly. Got it?

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.499
The earlier you leave, the better.

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:51.140
Yes.

00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:55.100
It's not that scary.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.979
It's an opportunity.

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:00.539
And I will quit drinking,

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.100
and we will start a new life together

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.300
Woohoo! Sweet!

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.620
Today, it's my turn!

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:11.060
I get to be the one who celebrates!

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.499
Let me enjoy myself today!

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:13.539
Take it easy, Auntie!

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:15.859
Easy, Mom!

00:07:19.859 --> 00:07:21.379
That's pure bliss!

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.140
I'm late—guilty as charged.

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:29.499
So late.

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:35.100
Dao,

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:36.819
I made it!

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.300
You remember that book by the Russian author?

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.379
I told you about it before—

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.339
Well, I made it too.

00:07:46.859 --> 00:07:47.939
What?

00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:51.300
I found the building for your press.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.379
It's my cousin's shophouse near Rajabhat.

00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:55.620
My papa said he’d give us

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.459
the base fund for the first three years.

00:07:57.859 --> 00:08:01.379
After that, if you can prove yourself successful,

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.580
he will give us all the shares as a wedding gift.

00:08:06.859 --> 00:08:07.979
Dao—

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.300
From now on,

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.580
you’ll have your own newspaper,

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.100
just like you always dreamed.

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:15.379
You can fight for justice.

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:16.740
You’ll never have to bow to anyone again.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.899
I’ll help you edit the stories.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.019
I guarantee I'll be most neutral.

00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:24.700
I'll be fearless unlike—

00:08:31.419 --> 00:08:32.780
What's wrong?

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.019
Aren't you happy?

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:44.780
I am... but I can't do this to you, Dao.

00:08:47.859 --> 00:08:48.899
That's okay.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.060
We can talk about it later.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.539
You must be tired, Ran.

00:08:55.539 --> 00:08:56.819
Let's order some food.

00:09:02.499 --> 00:09:03.220
Dao—

00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:08.740
I have someone else.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.740
Who?

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:25.180
I can't tell you.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.260
Tell me—

00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:38.779
who is she?

00:09:46.379 --> 00:09:47.619
Are you going to say it?!

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.459
...That person is a man.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.180
Dao.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.539
Mr. Krailert.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.980
(I need some time, Sarasawadee)

00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.060
The violence the state unleashed on the students that day

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.419
was the act of a tail-tucked mutt,

00:12:02.419 --> 00:12:04.980
who succumbed to its own chicanery.

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:08.539
Whenever its power is challenged,

00:12:08.539 --> 00:12:10.419
the state falls back on the same tired means—

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.900
crushing truth with guns,

00:12:15.339 --> 00:12:17.659
silencing opposing voices with blood,

00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:19.980
and branding it

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.699
peace and order.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.060
But no matter how hard they try to bury it,

00:12:27.739 --> 00:12:30.180
truth rises, resounding like a bell’s toll.

00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:34.659
And no arsenal in the world

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.339
can put an end to our struggle for freedom.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:04.900
Give it to me.

00:13:11.659 --> 00:13:13.300
Why won't you stop?

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:15.980
Do you want all of us razed to the ground?

00:13:17.459 --> 00:13:18.699
I'm just doing my job.

00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:20.459
Your job is to listen to me.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.459
I've had enough.

00:13:22.619 --> 00:13:23.619
You're suspended.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.339
Wait, chief!

00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:26.419
Give me your camera!

00:13:30.739 --> 00:13:31.619
Stop!

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:31.459
(through rainforest / found treasure chest)

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.220
What are you folding?

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.180
Can't you tell?

00:16:02.459 --> 00:16:03.619
It's the moon.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.300
Meow. Meow.

00:16:33.579 --> 00:16:35.539
See—

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.619
now it's a full moon.

00:16:52.739 --> 00:16:54.379
Let me work for a bit.

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:15.459
Can I work on it too?

00:17:50.379 --> 00:17:53.539
Apollo 11 is now landing!

00:18:03.739 --> 00:18:05.379
Why are you here so early today?

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.820
No, I've been here since yesterday.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:10.980
Hah?

00:18:13.699 --> 00:18:15.339
And where the hell have you been?

00:18:15.739 --> 00:18:17.020
I’ve been around—

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.779
somewhere, but you two just didn’t see me,

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.579
because love is blind.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.180
(I miss you already.)

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.579
The order’s come from above.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.820
We must end this fast.

00:19:45.579 --> 00:19:47.659
It’s starting to spiral out of control.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.539
The students are going to stage another protest,

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.060
it’s going to happen very soon.

00:19:52.339 --> 00:19:54.339
If they manage to spark that flame,

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.100
the whole country could go up in fire.

00:20:00.739 --> 00:20:01.900
Colonel,

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.419
this is your task now.

00:20:05.499 --> 00:20:06.499
Yes, sir.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.100
I'll order a lockdown of the area

00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:12.300
so we can contain the protest site

00:20:12.699 --> 00:20:14.379
and prevent any uprising before it starts.

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:15.499
No,

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.539
I’ll send in an SS team to sabotage from inside.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.739
They won't even know

00:20:23.419 --> 00:20:25.699
who's under the stage.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.779
They could be some opportunists lurking for a chance

00:20:29.779 --> 00:20:31.459
to stir up chaos,

00:20:32.659 --> 00:20:33.980
or

00:20:34.379 --> 00:20:36.100
communists slipping in among them.

00:20:37.339 --> 00:20:38.699
they won’t even know

00:20:39.419 --> 00:20:41.060
who’s killing whom.

00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:48.459
But sir, we don't need to go that far.

00:20:49.459 --> 00:20:52.699
There are ways to maintain peace and order

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.220
without killing innocent people.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.499
Those hardliners aren't innocent!

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.300
But they are just students!

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.220
Then try your way.

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:25.020
Let's hope it works.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.579
But if it doesn’t...

00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:32.419
we'll do it my way.

00:21:34.539 --> 00:21:35.499
Yes, sir.

00:22:13.659 --> 00:22:15.100
The order’s come from above.

00:22:15.379 --> 00:22:17.100
We must end this fast.

00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:19.060
It’s starting to spiral out of control.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.699
Make sure we record everything during this time.

00:22:26.619 --> 00:22:27.419
Yes, sir.

00:22:34.459 --> 00:22:35.260
Veera—

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.539
be careful.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.419
Don't worry, sir.

00:22:42.699 --> 00:22:44.180
General Pracha's aide

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.779
is my classmate at the cadet school.

00:22:45.779 --> 00:22:47.180
I know him well.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.180
Even Siam Daily Mail was silenced,

00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:02.619
How would any other agencies dare to come?

00:23:03.499 --> 00:23:04.659
This time,

00:23:04.659 --> 00:23:06.579
we must gather all the news space

00:23:06.579 --> 00:23:08.260
we can from foreign presses.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.180
If they try to silence us,

00:23:10.539 --> 00:23:12.260
then we'll borrow outsiders’ mouthpieces

00:23:12.539 --> 00:23:14.419
to amplify our voice.

00:23:15.419 --> 00:23:17.659
And make it heard in every corner of the world!

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.100
This isn’t just about Huay Kam Saeng.

00:23:21.419 --> 00:23:23.260
We are being threatened.

00:23:23.659 --> 00:23:26.499
Our freedom of speech is being taken from us.

00:23:28.419 --> 00:23:29.539
If we can snatch it back,

00:23:29.539 --> 00:23:31.020
this will no longer be just about us.

00:23:31.699 --> 00:23:34.020
It will be for everyone to come forward and speak out.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.100
That's so damn true.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.020
If everyone is brave enough to speak up,

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.940
there won't be another Huay Kam Saeng.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:48.900
This time,

00:23:49.659 --> 00:23:51.339
we will have four speakers.

00:23:52.459 --> 00:23:54.060
There could be one more spot.

00:23:55.579 --> 00:23:56.619
Let me speak.

00:24:01.459 --> 00:24:02.579
You?

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.140
You'll be leaving in a couple of days.

00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:08.459
You don’t need to be involved in this.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.659
It's exactly because I'm leaving,

00:24:11.539 --> 00:24:12.860
that I must speak on that stage.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.659
Thank you so much, Victor.

00:24:17.779 --> 00:24:21.060
Use this chance to speak for all of us, bro!

00:24:32.779 --> 00:24:34.379
You're back, Sucha?

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.140
Did you get the record—

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:41.980
I'm not going!

00:24:42.539 --> 00:24:44.779
Why are you dragging me home all of a sudden?

00:24:45.739 --> 00:24:47.339
Just tell me what this is about!

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.060
This is an order.

00:24:53.499 --> 00:24:55.180
I’m telling you—

00:24:55.739 --> 00:24:58.900
don’t get involved with those hardliner students.

00:24:59.579 --> 00:25:00.419
Don't go out.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.779
Come on, Dad.

00:25:03.659 --> 00:25:05.860
I’m just earning a living.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.539
I don’t even have time to get involved with them.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.379
Promise me

00:25:13.579 --> 00:25:15.699
you won't go out tonight.

00:25:19.779 --> 00:25:20.739
Why?

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.459
Just say it.

00:25:26.379 --> 00:25:28.419
Okay.

00:25:52.779 --> 00:25:54.260
The sound’s still great.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.020
You’ve taken good care of it.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.220
Your store looks nice.

00:26:45.659 --> 00:26:47.579
But for the protest tonight—

00:26:47.699 --> 00:26:48.579
you can't go out, young master.

00:26:49.419 --> 00:26:50.619
I know.

00:26:51.579 --> 00:26:52.699
Tanwa—

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.060
wh...

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.100
Why are you here?

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.260
Trin's not here, right?

00:27:19.539 --> 00:27:21.339
Why does Phi Trin need to be here?

00:27:23.499 --> 00:27:25.539
Are you preparing for the protest?

00:27:26.379 --> 00:27:27.180
Yes.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.220
I've heard some very bad news about tonight.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.060
News?

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.579
From where?

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.300
Extremely bad news about the safety.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.860
You should avoid it at all cost.

00:27:43.379 --> 00:27:45.419
Don't throw meat to a lion.

00:27:48.539 --> 00:27:51.379
When the government wants to scare people,

00:27:51.379 --> 00:27:53.339
they usually leak news like this.

00:27:57.659 --> 00:28:00.779
But isn't this too obvious this time?

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.020
Victor,

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.459
you don't have to believe me.

00:28:12.779 --> 00:28:14.339
Just be careful.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.779
Is it this urgent, Uncle?

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.699
Yes, very urgent.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.539
I'll ask the driver to take you there now.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.779
You should get there before the district office closes.

00:28:32.659 --> 00:28:33.739
It's just a title deed...why do we need to...

00:28:33.739 --> 00:28:34.739
Excuse me.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:40.499
Good afternoon.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.100
Tanwa—

00:28:43.539 --> 00:28:45.459
why are you here? What happened?

00:28:46.499 --> 00:28:49.100
Nothing. I'm just in a hurry.

00:28:49.499 --> 00:28:51.900
I just need to finish painting the backdrop at the store.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.860
Trin, can you give me a hand?

00:28:58.699 --> 00:28:59.779
Right now?

00:29:02.539 --> 00:29:03.539
I'm sorry. I have to—

00:29:03.539 --> 00:29:04.659
It's okay. You can go.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.820
Your friend's in trouble.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.339
Help him first.

00:29:08.619 --> 00:29:09.300
And what about—

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.539
I'll take care of it myself.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:11.699
You can go.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:15.900
Let's go.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.260
Are you ready?

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:42.779
Of course.

00:29:44.499 --> 00:29:45.339
Go for it.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.260
It's alive and well in here— resounding in our heads,

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.539
waiting for the day it'll explode.

00:30:07.379 --> 00:30:08.539
Have faith in yourself.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.020
Just speak your feelings.

00:30:11.379 --> 00:30:12.419
That's all you need.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.379
Thank you, Ran.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.779
Are you ready?

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.539
We were right to hold this in a closed space.

00:30:28.739 --> 00:30:31.459
Otherwise, we’d end up as their fixed target.

00:30:34.539 --> 00:30:35.379
Yes.

00:30:44.459 --> 00:30:45.900
Everything will be okay.

00:30:46.739 --> 00:30:48.020
We just need the pictures

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.659
and reports from today

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.419
and circulate them.

00:30:57.659 --> 00:30:58.539
Let's go.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.020
I'm ready.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.100
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:31:29.699 --> 00:31:31.579
I just miss you.

00:31:31.579 --> 00:31:33.020
I want to stay with you.

00:31:35.539 --> 00:31:36.699
Are you okay?

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.619
Let's do some painting.

00:31:42.619 --> 00:31:43.820
Everything's in place, sir.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:46.820
Today,

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.419
I'm the commander of the SS unit.

00:31:51.539 --> 00:31:54.539
I have sole authority to command.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.779
No one acts outside my orders.

00:31:57.779 --> 00:31:58.860
Yes, sir.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:00.659
Inspect your arms.

00:32:11.619 --> 00:32:12.300
At your stations.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.300
Where is Veera?

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.820
I haven't seen Lieutenant Veera.

00:32:40.699 --> 00:32:41.779
Take a seat.

00:33:28.459 --> 00:33:31.659
Dhevi, goddess of celestial grace,

00:33:32.499 --> 00:33:35.379
thou reign in realms beyond my reach.

00:33:37.619 --> 00:33:40.260
This silent love shall ever dwell

00:33:40.419 --> 00:33:43.060
within my heart—its sole refuge.

00:33:43.379 --> 00:33:49.100
What if your Colonel knows about this?

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.779
But I think he wouldn't say a word,

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.940
because he himself is a disgusting pervert

00:34:07.659 --> 00:34:09.860
with a penchant for sodomy,

00:34:13.339 --> 00:34:14.539
isn't he?

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.579
If this news leaks,

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:40.339
Colonel Krailert, the army's top dog,

00:34:41.779 --> 00:34:43.619
will be reduced to nothing but a sick faggot.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.659
And his wife, your goddess Dhevi,

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:50.140
secretly having an affair with his own aide.

00:34:51.379 --> 00:34:52.779
It will be the scandal for the whole country

00:34:52.779 --> 00:34:54.060
to run its mouth on for a century.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:55.260
Don’t!

00:35:37.539 --> 00:35:39.100
I'm begging you.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.739
What do you have in exchange?

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.820
Is it what I'm thinking of?

00:36:49.779 --> 00:36:52.140
I only have one condition.

00:36:56.779 --> 00:36:58.260
Don't drag the Colonel

00:37:02.459 --> 00:37:04.459
and Mrs. Dhevi through the mud.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.140
Why do you like these colors, Trin?

00:37:17.739 --> 00:37:19.300
Bluish purple,

00:37:20.659 --> 00:37:22.539
pastel pink,

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.579
grayish orange.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.499
Those are the colors of Paris' vanilla sky.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.619
Vanilla color?

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.419
Have you ever heard of it?

00:37:42.739 --> 00:37:44.260
Vanilla sky

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.100
is when the last ray of light leaves the sky

00:37:48.459 --> 00:37:49.739
before darkness falls.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.140
Why?

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.100
When I was in Paris,

00:38:07.579 --> 00:38:09.619
the picture etched in my memory

00:38:10.659 --> 00:38:12.419
was the first time

00:38:12.419 --> 00:38:15.419
I looked at the sky from beneath the Pont Neuf bridge.

00:38:17.539 --> 00:38:19.060
The clear sky

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.300
turned pastel,

00:38:22.699 --> 00:38:24.180
and from pastel

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.339
into dark blue.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.539
The moments when the sky shifts from one color to another

00:38:32.459 --> 00:38:33.980
are the most magical.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:47.860
Speaking of which...it reminds me of Victor.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.459
Victor.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.220
Umm.

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.860
That kid once asked me

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.339
how he could know where the sky is most beautiful

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.020
if he's never seen the sky elsewhere.

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.820
I'm so happy for him.

00:39:06.339 --> 00:39:08.379
He'll be leaving for America in a couple of days.

00:39:09.419 --> 00:39:11.300
His life will be much better.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.100
Is that so?

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.739
He must be excited.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.459
He's always said

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:26.180
how he wishes to see the sky elsewhere.

00:39:33.499 --> 00:39:35.020
Sometimes, I think

00:39:35.699 --> 00:39:38.499
that kid might understand life better than me.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.619
He’s so determined to get what he wants.

00:39:45.499 --> 00:39:50.060
He never doubts the path he’s chosen.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.619
Shall we go together?

00:40:14.499 --> 00:40:16.779
...to see the vanilla sky

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.260
in Paris,

00:40:39.419 --> 00:40:43.860
and witness it with our own eyes.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.060
No.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.699
It shouldn't be like this.

00:41:07.779 --> 00:41:09.579
Victor and his friends are staging the protest tonight.

00:41:11.499 --> 00:41:13.419
But there could be a full riot control.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:15.940
Where?

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:18.860
At Saeng Tawan warehouse.

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.499
Since when did you know about this?

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:23.659
Trin!

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:24.820
Trin!

00:41:29.459 --> 00:41:30.060
Hey!

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.499
You can't go out, Mr. Tanwa!

00:41:31.499 --> 00:41:32.619
They're starting the protest.

00:41:33.339 --> 00:41:34.659
What's the hell is this?

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:35.980
Let me go!

00:41:38.779 --> 00:41:40.339
Go home, Trin!

00:41:40.659 --> 00:41:41.499
Go home!

00:41:41.779 --> 00:41:42.619
Don't go there!

00:41:43.739 --> 00:41:44.579
Go home!

00:41:44.579 --> 00:41:46.060
Go to your house!

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.419
All this time,

00:41:58.419 --> 00:42:00.900
we’ve seen how the authority tries to silence us—

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.180
to strip away our freedom of speech.

00:42:03.459 --> 00:42:06.339
They don’t want us to know the problem.

00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:08.539
They don’t want us to ask questions.

00:42:08.699 --> 00:42:11.140
They don’t want us to fight for justice.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.379
But there's one thing they'll never understand.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.260
the voice of every single one of you

00:42:19.539 --> 00:42:21.140
has never disappeared.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:21.860
Yes!

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.180
It’s alive and well in here,

00:42:23.659 --> 00:42:25.020
— resounding in our heads,

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.180
waiting for the day it'll explode!

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.860
I know what it feels like to have no place to stand.

00:42:37.539 --> 00:42:39.140
I was born here.

00:42:39.379 --> 00:42:40.499
I grew up here.

00:42:40.739 --> 00:42:42.419
Only my father came from another country.

00:42:42.419 --> 00:42:43.900
People have always seen me as an outsider.

00:42:44.379 --> 00:42:49.100
But I'm standing here today, on this land,

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.739
speaking before you,

00:42:50.739 --> 00:42:52.339
because I have the same right as everyone!

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.260
The authority wants us to feel estranged.

00:43:02.699 --> 00:43:04.220
They tell us we're too worthless.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:05.980
They order us to keep our mouths shut,

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.459
bow our heads,

00:43:07.459 --> 00:43:08.379
and obey.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.940
But they forgot one thing:

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.579
They might be able to shut us down,

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.300
close our eyes,

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.220
but they will never stop our thoughts!

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.739
Today, I—

00:43:25.739 --> 00:43:28.860
Victor Salenko, won't be the only one speaking.

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.820
I'm inviting you, brothers and sisters,

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:33.499
to speak the truths in your minds.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.419
Speak out!

00:43:35.419 --> 00:43:36.060
Yes!

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.060
Say what you know is right!

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:38.940
Yes!

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.379
Say what those in power don't want to hear!

00:43:41.379 --> 00:43:42.260
Yes!

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.300
Speak—

00:43:43.539 --> 00:43:47.419
without succumbing to any threat or fear!

00:43:58.379 --> 00:44:00.739
Just stand up, and we've already won!

00:44:00.739 --> 00:44:03.980
Just stand up, and we've already won!

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.419
Anyone want to speak on the stage?

00:44:26.379 --> 00:44:27.579
Victor!

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.980
Victor!

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:34.100
Victor!

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.060
Victor!

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:39.980
Phi Trin!

00:44:40.459 --> 00:44:41.980
Did you hear my speech?

00:44:43.619 --> 00:44:44.739
I—

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.140
I’ve never stood on a stage like this before.

00:44:49.419 --> 00:44:52.060
But today—I refuse to be silent!

00:45:03.779 --> 00:45:05.339
Hey! Stop!

00:45:56.499 --> 00:45:58.260
Nobody move!

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:51.900
The communists—they purged one another, sir.

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.499
Why did you fucking fire your weapon!?

00:47:05.619 --> 00:47:06.779
Who ordered you!

00:47:07.339 --> 00:47:08.140
Bastard!

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:09.860
Fucking purged one another? You think I'm stupid!?

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.339
This was staged!

00:47:11.339 --> 00:47:12.260
It was you!

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.140
Who gave you the order! You were gone just before—

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:14.699
Tell me!

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:16.699
Answer me!

00:47:16.699 --> 00:47:17.499
Answer!

00:47:17.659 --> 00:47:19.180
I told you to answer me!

00:47:19.659 --> 00:47:20.579
Answer!

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:40.060
Shut down the area.

00:47:47.619 --> 00:47:48.659
Victor.

00:47:56.499 --> 00:47:57.900
Wake up, Victor.

00:48:01.739 --> 00:48:03.140
Wake up, Victor.

00:48:08.659 --> 00:48:09.940
Victor.

00:48:12.699 --> 00:48:14.379
Call the damn ambulance!

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.100
Victor.

00:48:22.379 --> 00:48:23.820
Wake up, Victor.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:26.060
Get up, Trin.

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:28.300
- Victor / - Get up, Trin.

00:48:28.539 --> 00:48:29.539
He's dead.

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:31.419
He's dead.

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.739
Victor!

00:48:57.779 --> 00:48:59.659
- Victor! / - Why did you shoot my friend!?

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.579
Bastard! Why did you kill my friend!?

00:49:01.579 --> 00:49:02.539
Victor!

00:49:03.499 --> 00:49:04.659
Let me go!

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.940
Why did you shoot my friend!?

00:49:07.619 --> 00:49:09.180
Why did you do this him?

00:49:11.579 --> 00:49:12.659
It was you!

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:14.339
Bastard!

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.140
You fucking good, huh?

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.180
Why don’t you fuckin’ kill them all!?

00:49:18.419 --> 00:49:20.060
Just fuckin' kill me!

00:49:21.339 --> 00:49:22.900
Just fuckin' kill all Thais!

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:24.260
You fucking good, so just do it!

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:25.339
Victor!

00:49:25.339 --> 00:49:26.459
Just kill me!

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.020
Why did you shoot my friend!?

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.860
My friend is also human!

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.140
Why did you fucking shoot my friend!?

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:35.260
Let me go!

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.900
Victor!

00:49:37.619 --> 00:49:38.619
Please.

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:41.260
Don't touch me!

00:49:42.379 --> 00:49:44.020
Let me go!

00:49:48.699 --> 00:49:49.860
Victor!

00:49:50.339 --> 00:49:52.699
- Victor! / - Why shoot my friend!

00:49:52.699 --> 00:49:54.260
My friend!

00:49:54.579 --> 00:49:55.900
Victor!

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.379
Let me go!

00:50:04.379 --> 00:50:05.699
Let me go!

00:50:07.499 --> 00:50:09.379
Let me go, fucking bastard!

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:23.940
Fuck you!

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:25.539
Hey! What are you doing!?

00:50:28.659 --> 00:50:30.820
How could you let him walk to his death like that!?

00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:37.339
How could

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:40.260
you do this?

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:05.379
What am I supposed to do when I get there, Nuch?

00:52:05.379 --> 00:52:08.539
I don't know if we need to change

00:52:08.539 --> 00:52:09.499
I still don’t know what kind of clothes

00:52:09.499 --> 00:52:10.499
we’re going to need there.

00:52:10.499 --> 00:52:11.820
And the weather,

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.980
I still can't imagine how it would be.

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.300
I'm quite excited, you know.

00:52:16.739 --> 00:52:18.459
Am I going to adjust alright?

00:52:38.579 --> 00:52:40.379
Why does it have to be Victor?

00:52:40.619 --> 00:52:42.579
Why did Victor have to die?

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.260
How could he leave us all behind?

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:53.699
How could you let him die?

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.180
That's enough, Nuch.

00:52:57.699 --> 00:52:59.820
Victor won’t be coming back, no matter what.

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:06.300
My son...

00:53:08.459 --> 00:53:09.619
He had already chosen—

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:14.260
He chose to do what he believed in

00:53:17.379 --> 00:53:18.659
until the very end.

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:30.140
Do we really need to wait until tomorrow

00:53:31.699 --> 00:53:33.499
to see Victor?

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:40.180
I'll call the hospital first thing in the morning.

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:43.860
If the officers permit,

00:53:45.619 --> 00:53:47.820
I'll take everyone to see Victor

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.419
at the Police General Hospital.

00:54:26.619 --> 00:54:28.220
His shirt is all wrinkled now.

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:30.619
I need to iron it again.

00:54:47.499 --> 00:54:48.980
It's all wrinkled.

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:53.220
It's alright, Num.

00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:57.419
He doesn't need it anymore.

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:35.820
Sir,

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.619
we've found Lieutenant Veera.

00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:33.980
(Freak Faggot Pervert)

00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:52.539
My men will clean up for you.

00:58:52.779 --> 00:58:55.140
I’ll give you six months’ rent upfront,

00:58:55.779 --> 00:58:57.180
but don't let this leak to the news.

00:58:57.980 --> 00:58:59.300
Just tell everyone

00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:01.900
Lieutenant Veera died of a sudden heart attack.

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:02.779
Can you?

00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.180
Yes, sir.

00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:13.300
do you happen to know Veera’s fiancée?

00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:15.659
Has Amporn been informed about this?

00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:18.860
She wouldn't know. They broke up a long time ago.

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:22.379
Amporn's already married and has two kids.

00:59:53.779 --> 00:59:55.100
How's everything?

00:59:57.419 --> 00:59:59.220
Trin hasn't come home yet.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.220
Trin's alright.

01:00:05.779 --> 01:00:07.180
I've met him.

01:00:15.619 --> 01:00:17.180
Anything wrong?

01:00:17.699 --> 01:00:19.180
You look stressed.

01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:31.100
Veera

01:00:33.419 --> 01:00:34.499
is dead.

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:42.820
Why did he die?

01:00:46.499 --> 01:00:49.180
Is it because of today's protest?

01:00:51.699 --> 01:00:52.739
Sort of.

01:01:00.659 --> 01:01:03.619
Please let me know if you need any help with the funeral.

01:01:06.699 --> 01:01:08.739
Veera's been with us for a long time.

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.260
Your shoes are dirty.

01:03:40.539 --> 01:03:41.739
Use this.

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.619
It will be dawn soon.

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:48.339
From the autopsy report,

01:04:48.339 --> 01:04:50.060
the deceased has been identified

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:53.940
as Victor Boonterdtoon, a student of Thai–Russian descent.

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:58.900
Victor was one of the leaders of the protest held last night.

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:01.419
Police officials have reported finding initial evidence

01:05:01.419 --> 01:05:03.260
suggesting that last night’s casualties

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:05.820
were staged by the Thai Communist Party

01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:07.379
in an attempt to place blame

01:05:07.379 --> 01:05:10.020
on the Thai government by by inciting violence,

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:13.020
allegedly led by Victor himself.

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:42.779
Trin.

01:05:51.699 --> 01:05:52.779
